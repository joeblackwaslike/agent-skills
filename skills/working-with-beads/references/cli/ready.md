Show ready work (open issues with no active blockers).

Excludes in_progress, blocked, deferred, and hooked issues. This uses the
GetReadyWork API which applies blocker-aware semantics to find truly claimable work.

Note: 'bd list --ready' uses the same blocker-aware ready-work semantics.

Use --mol to filter to a specific molecule's steps:
  bd ready --mol bd-patrol   # Show ready steps within molecule

Use --gated to find molecules ready for gate-resume dispatch:
  bd ready --gated           # Find molecules where a gate closed

Use --claim to atomically claim the first ready issue matching the filters:
  bd ready --claim --json

This is useful for agents executing molecules to see which steps can run next.

Usage:
  bd ready [flags]

Flags:
  -a, --assignee string              Filter by assignee
      --brief                        Omit the free-form text (description, design, acceptance criteria, notes, payload, waiters) from each row. Filters that read those fields still select on them. An omitted field is indistinguishable from an empty one; fetch a whole issue with bd show. Requires --json, and cannot be combined with --claim, --gated, --mol or --explain.
      --claim                        Atomically claim the first ready issue matching the filters
      --exclude-label strings        Exclude issues that have ANY of these labels
      --exclude-type strings         Exclude issue types from results (comma-separated or repeatable, e.g., --exclude-type=convoy,epic)
      --explain                      Show dependency-aware reasoning for why issues are ready or blocked
      --gated                        Find molecules ready for gate-resume dispatch
      --has-metadata-key string      Filter issues that have this metadata key set
  -h, --help                         help for ready
      --include-deferred             Include issues with future defer_until timestamps
      --include-ephemeral            Include ephemeral issues (wisps) in results
  -l, --label strings                Filter by labels (AND: must have ALL). Can combine with --label-any
      --label-any strings            Filter by labels (OR: must have AT LEAST ONE). Can combine with --label
      --label-pattern string         Filter by label glob pattern (e.g., 'tech-*' matches tech-debt, tech-legacy)
      --label-regex string           Filter by label regex pattern (e.g., 'tech-(debt|legacy)')
  -n, --limit int                    Maximum issues to show (use 0 for unlimited) (default 100)
      --max-rows int                 Hard upper bound on rows fetched from storage. Returns a non-zero exit (code 2) and an error to stderr if exceeded. 0 disables (the default). Overrides BEADS_MAX_ROWS for this invocation. Useful in CI/agent rigs that want a circuit breaker against pathological queries. Not supported under --proxied-server: an explicit --max-rows or BEADS_MAX_ROWS cap errors out rather than silently going unenforced.
      --metadata-field stringArray   Filter by metadata field (key=value, repeatable)
      --mol string                   Filter to steps within a specific molecule
      --mol-type string              Filter by molecule type: swarm, patrol, or work
      --offset int                   Skip the first N matching results (0-based). Only supported under --proxied-server.
      --parent string                Filter to descendants of this bead/epic
      --plain                        Display issues as a plain numbered list
      --pretty                       Display issues in a tree format with status/priority symbols (default true)
  -p, --priority int                 Filter by priority
  -s, --sort string                  Sort policy: priority (default), hybrid, oldest (default "priority")
  -t, --type string                  Filter by issue type (task, bug, feature, epic, decision, merge-request). Aliases: mr→merge-request, feat→feature, mol→molecule, dec/adr→decision
  -u, --unassigned                   Show only unassigned issues

Global Flags:
      --actor string              Actor name for audit trail (default: $BEADS_ACTOR, git user.name, $USER)
      --cpu-profile               Generate CPU profile for performance analysis
      --database string           Run against a different server database for this invocation, without changing the project's configured database (proxied-server mode only)
      --db string                 Database path (default: auto-discover .beads/*.db). In proxied-server mode, a value that isn't an existing path is treated as a database name override (see --database)
  -C, --directory string          Change to this directory before running the command (like git -C)
      --dolt-auto-commit string   Dolt auto-commit policy (off|on|batch). 'on': commit after each write. 'batch': defer commits to bd dolt commit; uncommitted changes persist in the working set until then (a live batch-mode bd process also flushes on SIGTERM/SIGHUP, except in proxied-server mode, where bd dolt commit is the only flush point). In proxied-server mode the deferral covers the writes the CLI makes on that route, including config and version metadata; explicit commit points (bd batch, bd mol bond/pour/squash, bd mol wisp create, and the wisp half of bd mol burn) still commit, and a bd serve process on the same database is unaffected. Default: on. Override via config key dolt.auto-commit
      --global                    Use the global shared-server database (beads_global)
      --ignore-schema-skew        Proceed despite forward schema drift (some queries may fail)
      --json                      Output in JSON format
      --mem-profile string        Write heap profile to FILE on exit (also respects BEADS_MEM_PROFILE)
      --no-color                  Disable color output (also: NO_COLOR=1 or CLICOLOR=0)
  -q, --quiet                     Suppress non-essential output (errors only)
      --readonly                  Read-only mode: block write operations (for worker sandboxes)
      --sandbox                   Sandbox mode: disables Dolt auto-push
  -v, --verbose                   Enable verbose/debug output
