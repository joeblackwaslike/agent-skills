Show the status of the Dolt engine for the current project.

In embedded mode, reports that the Dolt engine runs in-process and shows
the on-disk data directory. For beads-managed (local) servers, displays
PID, port, and data directory from the local PID file. For externally-
managed servers — a shared server (dolt.shared-server: true), a remote
dolt_server_host, or a local server managed outside bd (dolt.auto-start:
false, e.g. an orchestrator-shared sql-server) — pings the configured
endpoint via SQL and reports reachability, server version, and database.

In proxied-server mode, reports the proxy (the endpoint every bd command
connects through) and the dolt backend behind it separately, read from the
proxy's own process records. Reporting starts nothing: a quiesced workspace
is shown as not running, and the next bd command launches it.

Usage:
  bd dolt status [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for status

Global Flags:
      --actor string              Actor name for audit trail (default: $BEADS_ACTOR, git user.name, $USER)
      --cpu-profile               Generate CPU profile for performance analysis
      --database string           Run against a different server database for this invocation, without changing the project's configured database (proxied-server mode only)
      --db string                 Database path (default: auto-discover .beads/*.db). In proxied-server mode, a value that isn't an existing path is treated as a database name override (see --database)
  -C, --directory string          Change to this directory before running the command (like git -C)
      --dolt-auto-commit string   Dolt auto-commit policy (off|on|batch). 'on': commit after each write. 'batch': defer commits to bd dolt commit; uncommitted changes persist in the working set until then (a live batch-mode bd process also flushes on SIGTERM/SIGHUP, except in proxied-server mode, where bd dolt commit is the only flush point). In proxied-server mode the deferral covers the writes the CLI makes on that route, including config and version metadata; explicit commit points (bd batch, bd mol bond/pour/squash, bd mol wisp create, and the wisp half of bd mol burn) still commit, and a bd serve process on the same database is unaffected. Default: on. Override via config key dolt.auto-commit
      --global                    Use the global shared-server database (beads_global)
      --ignore-schema-skew        Proceed despite forward schema drift (some queries may fail)
      --json                      Output in JSON format
      --mem-profile string        Write heap profile to FILE on exit (also respects BEADS_MEM_PROFILE)
      --no-color                  Disable color output (also: NO_COLOR=1 or CLICOLOR=0)
  -q, --quiet                     Suppress non-essential output (errors only)
      --readonly                  Read-only mode: block write operations (for worker sandboxes)
      --sandbox                   Sandbox mode: disables Dolt auto-push
  -v, --verbose                   Enable verbose/debug output
