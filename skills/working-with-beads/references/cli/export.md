Export all issues to JSONL (newline-delimited JSON) format.

Each line is a complete JSON object representing one issue, including its
labels, dependencies, and comments.

This command is for issue export, migration, and interoperability. It exports
records from the issues table; it is not a full database backup and does not
capture Dolt branches, commit history, working-set state, or non-issue tables.
For supported full backup/restore flows, use 'bd backup init', 'bd backup sync',
and 'bd backup restore'.

By default, exports only regular issues (excluding infrastructure beads
like agents, roles, and messages). Use --all to include everything.

Memories (from 'bd remember') are excluded by default because they may
contain sensitive agent context. Use --include-memories or --all to
include them.

EXAMPLES:
  bd export                              # Export issues to stdout
  bd export -o issues.jsonl              # Export issues to file
  bd export --include-memories           # Export issues + memories
  bd export --all -o full.jsonl          # Include infra + templates + gates + memories
  bd export --scrub -o clean.jsonl       # Exclude test/pollution records

Usage:
  bd export [flags]

Flags:
      --all                         Include all records (infra, templates, gates, memories)
      --exclude-owner stringArray   Exclude issues created by this identity (repeatable; also reads export.exclude_owners config)
  -h, --help                        help for export
      --include-infra               Include infrastructure beads (agents, roles, messages)
      --include-memories            Include persistent memories (from 'bd remember') in the export
  -o, --output string               Output file path (default: stdout)
      --scrub                       Exclude test/pollution records
      --verbose                     Print filtered issue count when owners are excluded

Global Flags:
      --actor string              Actor name for audit trail (default: $BEADS_ACTOR, git user.name, $USER)
      --cpu-profile               Generate CPU profile for performance analysis
      --database string           Run against a different server database for this invocation, without changing the project's configured database (proxied-server mode only)
      --db string                 Database path (default: auto-discover .beads/*.db). In proxied-server mode, a value that isn't an existing path is treated as a database name override (see --database)
  -C, --directory string          Change to this directory before running the command (like git -C)
      --dolt-auto-commit string   Dolt auto-commit policy (off|on|batch). 'on': commit after each write. 'batch': defer commits to bd dolt commit; uncommitted changes persist in the working set until then (a live batch-mode bd process also flushes on SIGTERM/SIGHUP, except in proxied-server mode, where bd dolt commit is the only flush point). In proxied-server mode the deferral covers the writes the CLI makes on that route, including config and version metadata; explicit commit points (bd batch, bd mol bond/pour/squash, bd mol wisp create, and the wisp half of bd mol burn) still commit, and a bd serve process on the same database is unaffected. Default: on. Override via config key dolt.auto-commit
      --global                    Use the global shared-server database (beads_global)
      --ignore-schema-skew        Proceed despite forward schema drift (some queries may fail)
      --json                      Output in JSON format
      --mem-profile string        Write heap profile to FILE on exit (also respects BEADS_MEM_PROFILE)
      --no-color                  Disable color output (also: NO_COLOR=1 or CLICOLOR=0)
  -q, --quiet                     Suppress non-essential output (errors only)
      --readonly                  Read-only mode: block write operations (for worker sandboxes)
      --sandbox                   Sandbox mode: disables Dolt auto-push
