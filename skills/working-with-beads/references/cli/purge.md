Permanently delete closed ephemeral beads and their associated data.

Closed ephemeral beads (wisps, transient molecules) accumulate rapidly and
have no value once closed. This command removes them to reclaim storage.

Deletes: issues, dependencies, labels, events, and comments for matching beads.
Skips: pinned beads (protected).

To delete closed non-ephemeral beads (regular tasks, features, bugs, etc.)
use `bd prune` instead.

For full Dolt storage reclaim after deleting many rows, follow with `bd flatten`
so history can be collapsed and old chunks can be garbage-collected.

EXAMPLES:
  bd purge                           # Preview what would be purged
  bd purge --force                   # Delete all closed ephemeral beads
  bd purge --older-than 7d --force   # Only purge items closed 7+ days ago
  bd purge --pattern "*-wisp-*"      # Only purge matching ID pattern
  bd purge --dry-run                 # Detailed preview with stats

Usage:
  bd purge [flags]

Flags:
      --dry-run             Preview what would be purged with stats
  -f, --force               Actually purge (without this, shows preview)
  -h, --help                help for purge
      --older-than string   Only purge beads closed more than N ago (e.g., 7d, 2w, 30)
      --pattern string      Only purge beads matching ID glob pattern (e.g., *-wisp-*)

Global Flags:
      --actor string              Actor name for audit trail (default: $BEADS_ACTOR, git user.name, $USER)
      --db string                 Database path (default: auto-discover .beads/*.db)
  -C, --directory string          Change to this directory before running the command (like git -C)
      --dolt-auto-commit string   Dolt auto-commit policy (off|on|batch). 'on': commit after each write. 'batch': defer commits to bd dolt commit; uncommitted changes persist in the working set until then. SIGTERM/SIGHUP flush pending batch commits. Default: off. Override via config key dolt.auto-commit
      --global                    Use the global shared-server database (beads_global)
      --ignore-schema-skew        Proceed despite forward schema drift (some queries may fail)
      --json                      Output in JSON format
      --profile                   Generate CPU profile for performance analysis
  -q, --quiet                     Suppress non-essential output (errors only)
      --readonly                  Read-only mode: block write operations (for worker sandboxes)
      --sandbox                   Sandbox mode: disables Dolt auto-push
  -v, --verbose                   Enable verbose/debug output
