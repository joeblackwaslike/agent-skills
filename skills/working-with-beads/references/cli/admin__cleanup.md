Delete closed issues to reduce database size.

This command permanently removes closed issues from the database.

NOTE: This command only manages issue lifecycle (closed -> deleted). For general
health checks and automatic repairs, use 'bd doctor --fix' instead.

By default, deletes ALL closed issues. Use --older-than to only delete
issues closed before a certain date.

EXAMPLES:
  bd admin cleanup --force                          # Delete all closed issues
  bd admin cleanup --older-than 30 --force          # Only issues closed 30+ days ago
  bd admin cleanup --ephemeral --force              # Only closed wisps (transient molecules)
  bd admin cleanup --dry-run                        # Preview what would be deleted

SAFETY:
- Requires --force flag to actually delete (unless --dry-run)
- Supports --cascade to delete dependents
- Shows preview of what will be deleted
- Use --json for programmatic output

SEE ALSO:
  bd doctor --fix    Automatic health checks and repairs (recommended for routine maintenance)
  bd admin compact   Compact old closed issues to save space

Usage:
  bd admin cleanup [flags]

Flags:
      --cascade          Recursively delete all dependent issues
      --dry-run          Preview what would be deleted without making changes
      --ephemeral        Only delete closed wisps (transient molecules)
  -f, --force            Actually delete (without this flag, shows error)
  -h, --help             help for cleanup
      --older-than int   Only delete issues closed more than N days ago (0 = all closed issues)

Global Flags:
      --actor string              Actor name for audit trail (default: $BEADS_ACTOR, git user.name, $USER)
      --cpu-profile               Generate CPU profile for performance analysis
      --database string           Run against a different server database for this invocation, without changing the project's configured database (proxied-server mode only)
      --db string                 Database path (default: auto-discover .beads/*.db). In proxied-server mode, a value that isn't an existing path is treated as a database name override (see --database)
  -C, --directory string          Change to this directory before running the command (like git -C)
      --dolt-auto-commit string   Dolt auto-commit policy (off|on|batch). 'on': commit after each write. 'batch': defer commits to bd dolt commit; uncommitted changes persist in the working set until then (a live batch-mode bd process also flushes on SIGTERM/SIGHUP, except in proxied-server mode, where bd dolt commit is the only flush point). In proxied-server mode the deferral covers the writes the CLI makes on that route, including config and version metadata; explicit commit points (bd batch, bd mol bond/pour/squash, bd mol wisp create, and the wisp half of bd mol burn) still commit, and a bd serve process on the same database is unaffected. Default: on. Override via config key dolt.auto-commit
      --global                    Use the global shared-server database (beads_global)
      --ignore-schema-skew        Proceed despite forward schema drift (some queries may fail)
      --json                      Output in JSON format
      --mem-profile string        Write heap profile to FILE on exit (also respects BEADS_MEM_PROFILE)
      --no-color                  Disable color output (also: NO_COLOR=1 or CLICOLOR=0)
  -q, --quiet                     Suppress non-essential output (errors only)
      --readonly                  Read-only mode: block write operations (for worker sandboxes)
      --sandbox                   Sandbox mode: disables Dolt auto-push
  -v, --verbose                   Enable verbose/debug output
