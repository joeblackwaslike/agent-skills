Restore the pre-compaction content of a compacted issue.

When an issue is compacted, its description/design/notes/acceptance criteria
are summarized and the originals are archived to a compaction snapshot. This
command recovers that original content.

By default it is read-only: it displays the archived content without modifying
the database. Pass --apply to write the original content back into the issue
and step its compaction level back down.

If no archived snapshot exists (e.g. the issue was compacted by an older bd
before snapshot archiving), restore falls back to a best-effort reconstruction
from Dolt version history, which can only be displayed, not applied.

Usage:
  bd restore <issue-id> [flags]

Flags:
      --apply   Write the restored content back into the issue (default: display only)
  -h, --help    help for restore
      --json    Output restore results in JSON format

Global Flags:
      --actor string              Actor name for audit trail (default: $BEADS_ACTOR, git user.name, $USER)
      --cpu-profile               Generate CPU profile for performance analysis
      --database string           Run against a different server database for this invocation, without changing the project's configured database (proxied-server mode only)
      --db string                 Database path (default: auto-discover .beads/*.db). In proxied-server mode, a value that isn't an existing path is treated as a database name override (see --database)
  -C, --directory string          Change to this directory before running the command (like git -C)
      --dolt-auto-commit string   Dolt auto-commit policy (off|on|batch). 'on': commit after each write. 'batch': defer commits to bd dolt commit; uncommitted changes persist in the working set until then (a live batch-mode bd process also flushes on SIGTERM/SIGHUP, except in proxied-server mode, where bd dolt commit is the only flush point). In proxied-server mode the deferral covers the writes the CLI makes on that route, including config and version metadata; explicit commit points (bd batch, bd mol bond/pour/squash, bd mol wisp create, and the wisp half of bd mol burn) still commit, and a bd serve process on the same database is unaffected. Default: on. Override via config key dolt.auto-commit
      --global                    Use the global shared-server database (beads_global)
      --ignore-schema-skew        Proceed despite forward schema drift (some queries may fail)
      --mem-profile string        Write heap profile to FILE on exit (also respects BEADS_MEM_PROFILE)
      --no-color                  Disable color output (also: NO_COLOR=1 or CLICOLOR=0)
  -q, --quiet                     Suppress non-essential output (errors only)
      --readonly                  Read-only mode: block write operations (for worker sandboxes)
      --sandbox                   Sandbox mode: disables Dolt auto-push
  -v, --verbose                   Enable verbose/debug output
