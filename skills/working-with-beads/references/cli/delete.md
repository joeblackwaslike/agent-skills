Delete one or more issues and clean up all references to them.
This command will:
1. Remove all dependency links (any type, both directions) involving the issues
2. Update text references to "[deleted:ID]" in directly connected issues
3. Permanently delete the issues from the database

This is a destructive operation that cannot be undone. Use with caution.

BATCH DELETION:
Delete multiple issues at once:
  bd delete bd-1 bd-2 bd-3 --force

Delete from file (one ID per line):
  bd delete --from-file deletions.txt --force

Preview before deleting:
  bd delete --from-file deletions.txt --dry-run

DEPENDENCY HANDLING (the same on a local database and against a team server):
Default: Fails if any issue has dependents not in deletion set
  bd delete bd-1 bd-2

Cascade: Recursively delete all dependents
  bd delete bd-1 --cascade --force

Force: Delete and orphan dependents
  bd delete bd-1 --force

Usage:
  bd delete <issue-id> [issue-id...] [flags]

Flags:
      --cascade            Recursively delete all dependent issues
      --dry-run            Preview what would be deleted without making changes
  -f, --force              Actually delete (without this flag, shows preview)
      --from-file string   Read issue IDs from file (one per line)
  -h, --help               help for delete

Global Flags:
      --actor string              Actor name for audit trail (default: $BEADS_ACTOR, git user.name, $USER)
      --cpu-profile               Generate CPU profile for performance analysis
      --database string           Run against a different server database for this invocation, without changing the project's configured database (proxied-server mode only)
      --db string                 Database path (default: auto-discover .beads/*.db). In proxied-server mode, a value that isn't an existing path is treated as a database name override (see --database)
  -C, --directory string          Change to this directory before running the command (like git -C)
      --dolt-auto-commit string   Dolt auto-commit policy (off|on|batch). 'on': commit after each write. 'batch': defer commits to bd dolt commit; uncommitted changes persist in the working set until then (a live batch-mode bd process also flushes on SIGTERM/SIGHUP, except in proxied-server mode, where bd dolt commit is the only flush point). In proxied-server mode the deferral covers the writes the CLI makes on that route, including config and version metadata; explicit commit points (bd batch, bd mol bond/pour/squash, bd mol wisp create, and the wisp half of bd mol burn) still commit, and a bd serve process on the same database is unaffected. Default: on. Override via config key dolt.auto-commit
      --global                    Use the global shared-server database (beads_global)
      --ignore-schema-skew        Proceed despite forward schema drift (some queries may fail)
      --json                      Output in JSON format
      --mem-profile string        Write heap profile to FILE on exit (also respects BEADS_MEM_PROFILE)
      --no-color                  Disable color output (also: NO_COLOR=1 or CLICOLOR=0)
  -q, --quiet                     Suppress non-essential output (errors only)
      --readonly                  Read-only mode: block write operations (for worker sandboxes)
      --sandbox                   Sandbox mode: disables Dolt auto-push
  -v, --verbose                   Enable verbose/debug output
