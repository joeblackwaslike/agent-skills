Manage molecules - work templates for agent workflows.

Protos are template epics with the "template" label. They define a DAG of work
that can be spawned to create real issues (molecules).

The molecule metaphor:
  - A proto is an uninstantiated template (reusable work pattern)
  - Spawning creates a molecule (real issues) from the proto
  - Variables ({{key}}) are substituted during spawning
  - Bonding combines protos or molecules into compounds
  - Distilling extracts a proto from an ad-hoc epic

Commands:
  show       Show proto/molecule structure and variables
  pour       Instantiate proto as persistent mol (liquid phase)
  wisp       Instantiate proto as ephemeral wisp (vapor phase)
  bond       Polymorphic combine: proto+proto, proto+mol, mol+mol
  squash     Condense molecule to digest
  burn       Discard wisp
  distill    Extract proto from ad-hoc epic

Use "bd formula list" to list available formulas.

Usage:
  bd mol [command]

Aliases:
  mol, protomolecule

Available Commands:
  bond          Bond two protos or molecules together
  burn          Delete a molecule without creating a digest
  current       Show current position in molecule workflow
  distill       Extract a formula from an existing epic
  last-activity Show last activity timestamp for a molecule
  pour          Instantiate a proto as a persistent mol (solid -> liquid)
  progress      Show molecule progress summary
  ready         Find molecules ready for gate-resume dispatch
  seed          Verify formula accessibility
  show          Show molecule details
  squash        Compress molecule execution into a digest
  stale         Detect complete-but-unclosed molecules
  wisp          Create or manage wisps (ephemeral molecules)

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for mol

Global Flags:
      --actor string              Actor name for audit trail (default: $BEADS_ACTOR, git user.name, $USER)
      --cpu-profile               Generate CPU profile for performance analysis
      --database string           Run against a different server database for this invocation, without changing the project's configured database (proxied-server mode only)
      --db string                 Database path (default: auto-discover .beads/*.db). In proxied-server mode, a value that isn't an existing path is treated as a database name override (see --database)
  -C, --directory string          Change to this directory before running the command (like git -C)
      --dolt-auto-commit string   Dolt auto-commit policy (off|on|batch). 'on': commit after each write. 'batch': defer commits to bd dolt commit; uncommitted changes persist in the working set until then (a live batch-mode bd process also flushes on SIGTERM/SIGHUP, except in proxied-server mode, where bd dolt commit is the only flush point). In proxied-server mode the deferral covers the writes the CLI makes on that route, including config and version metadata; explicit commit points (bd batch, bd mol bond/pour/squash, bd mol wisp create, and the wisp half of bd mol burn) still commit, and a bd serve process on the same database is unaffected. Default: on. Override via config key dolt.auto-commit
      --global                    Use the global shared-server database (beads_global)
      --ignore-schema-skew        Proceed despite forward schema drift (some queries may fail)
      --json                      Output in JSON format
      --mem-profile string        Write heap profile to FILE on exit (also respects BEADS_MEM_PROFILE)
      --no-color                  Disable color output (also: NO_COLOR=1 or CLICOLOR=0)
  -q, --quiet                     Suppress non-essential output (errors only)
      --readonly                  Read-only mode: block write operations (for worker sandboxes)
      --sandbox                   Sandbox mode: disables Dolt auto-push
  -v, --verbose                   Enable verbose/debug output
