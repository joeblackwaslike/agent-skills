Rename the issue prefix for all issues in the database.
This will update all issue IDs and all text references across all fields.

USE CASES:
- Shortening long prefixes (e.g., 'knowledge-work-' → 'kw-')
- Rebranding project naming conventions
- Consolidating multiple prefixes after database corruption
- Migrating to team naming standards

Prefix validation rules:
- Allowed characters: lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens
- Must start with a letter
- Must end with a hyphen (e.g., 'kw-', 'work-')
- Cannot be empty or just a hyphen

Multiple prefix detection and repair:
If issues have multiple prefixes (corrupted database), use --repair to consolidate them.
The --repair flag will rename all issues with incorrect prefixes to the new prefix,
preserving issues that already have the correct prefix.

EXAMPLES:
  bd rename-prefix kw-                # Rename from 'knowledge-work-' to 'kw-'
  bd rename-prefix mtg- --repair      # Consolidate multiple prefixes into 'mtg-'
  bd rename-prefix team- --dry-run    # Preview changes without applying

NOTE: This is a rare operation. Most users never need this command.

Usage:
  bd rename-prefix <new-prefix> [flags]

Flags:
      --dry-run   Preview changes without applying them
  -h, --help      help for rename-prefix
      --repair    Repair database with multiple prefixes by consolidating them

Global Flags:
      --actor string              Actor name for audit trail (default: $BEADS_ACTOR, git user.name, $USER)
      --cpu-profile               Generate CPU profile for performance analysis
      --database string           Run against a different server database for this invocation, without changing the project's configured database (proxied-server mode only)
      --db string                 Database path (default: auto-discover .beads/*.db). In proxied-server mode, a value that isn't an existing path is treated as a database name override (see --database)
  -C, --directory string          Change to this directory before running the command (like git -C)
      --dolt-auto-commit string   Dolt auto-commit policy (off|on|batch). 'on': commit after each write. 'batch': defer commits to bd dolt commit; uncommitted changes persist in the working set until then (a live batch-mode bd process also flushes on SIGTERM/SIGHUP, except in proxied-server mode, where bd dolt commit is the only flush point). In proxied-server mode the deferral covers the writes the CLI makes on that route, including config and version metadata; explicit commit points (bd batch, bd mol bond/pour/squash, bd mol wisp create, and the wisp half of bd mol burn) still commit, and a bd serve process on the same database is unaffected. Default: on. Override via config key dolt.auto-commit
      --global                    Use the global shared-server database (beads_global)
      --ignore-schema-skew        Proceed despite forward schema drift (some queries may fail)
      --json                      Output in JSON format
      --mem-profile string        Write heap profile to FILE on exit (also respects BEADS_MEM_PROFILE)
      --no-color                  Disable color output (also: NO_COLOR=1 or CLICOLOR=0)
  -q, --quiet                     Suppress non-essential output (errors only)
      --readonly                  Read-only mode: block write operations (for worker sandboxes)
      --sandbox                   Sandbox mode: disables Dolt auto-push
  -v, --verbose                   Enable verbose/debug output
