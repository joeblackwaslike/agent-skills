Release a claimed issue by clearing the assignee and resetting status to 'open'.

Use this when an agent crashes mid-work or you need to abandon a claimed task.
The issue becomes available for re-claiming by other agents.

Only the current assignee can release its own claim. Releasing another
actor's claim requires --force and should be coordinated with the holder
first — their claim may be live even if the issue looks idle. Prefer
letting lease expiry reclaim genuinely abandoned work.

With --if-assignee, the release is an atomic compare-and-swap (the inverse of
claim): the issue is released only while it is still assigned to the given
assignee. If the holder differs — e.g. the claim was already reclaimed and
re-taken by another worker — nothing is changed and bd exits nonzero with an
error naming the current holder. Use this from supervisors that must return a
specific worker's issue without ever clobbering someone else's live claim.
--if-assignee requires a non-empty assignee and cannot be combined with --force
(they encode contradictory intent).

Exit status: 0 when every issue was released; 1 when any release failed
(including an --if-assignee mismatch).

Examples:
  bd unclaim bd-123
  bd unclaim bd-123 --reason "Agent crashed"
  bd unclaim bd-123 bd-456
  bd unclaim bd-123 --if-assignee worker-7   # only if still held by worker-7

Usage:
  bd unclaim [id...] [flags]

Flags:
      --force                Release the claim even if held by a different actor (admin/reaper use)
  -h, --help                 help for unclaim
      --if-assignee string   Only release if still assigned to this assignee (atomic compare-and-swap; exits nonzero without changing the issue when the holder differs)
  -r, --reason string        Reason for unclaiming

Global Flags:
      --actor string              Actor name for audit trail (default: $BEADS_ACTOR, git user.name, $USER)
      --cpu-profile               Generate CPU profile for performance analysis
      --database string           Run against a different server database for this invocation, without changing the project's configured database (proxied-server mode only)
      --db string                 Database path (default: auto-discover .beads/*.db). In proxied-server mode, a value that isn't an existing path is treated as a database name override (see --database)
  -C, --directory string          Change to this directory before running the command (like git -C)
      --dolt-auto-commit string   Dolt auto-commit policy (off|on|batch). 'on': commit after each write. 'batch': defer commits to bd dolt commit; uncommitted changes persist in the working set until then (a live batch-mode bd process also flushes on SIGTERM/SIGHUP, except in proxied-server mode, where bd dolt commit is the only flush point). In proxied-server mode the deferral covers the writes the CLI makes on that route, including config and version metadata; explicit commit points (bd batch, bd mol bond/pour/squash, bd mol wisp create, and the wisp half of bd mol burn) still commit, and a bd serve process on the same database is unaffected. Default: on. Override via config key dolt.auto-commit
      --global                    Use the global shared-server database (beads_global)
      --ignore-schema-skew        Proceed despite forward schema drift (some queries may fail)
      --json                      Output in JSON format
      --mem-profile string        Write heap profile to FILE on exit (also respects BEADS_MEM_PROFILE)
      --no-color                  Disable color output (also: NO_COLOR=1 or CLICOLOR=0)
  -q, --quiet                     Suppress non-essential output (errors only)
      --readonly                  Read-only mode: block write operations (for worker sandboxes)
      --sandbox                   Sandbox mode: disables Dolt auto-push
  -v, --verbose                   Enable verbose/debug output
