Watch a run until it completes, showing its progress.

By default, all steps are displayed. The `--compact` option can be used to only
show the relevant/failed steps.

This command does not support authenticating via fine grained PATs
as it is not currently possible to create a PAT with the `checks:read` permission.


USAGE
  gh run watch <run-id> [flags]

FLAGS
      --compact        Show only relevant/failed steps
      --exit-status    Exit with non-zero status if run fails
  -i, --interval int   Refresh interval in seconds (default 3)

INHERITED FLAGS
      --help                     Show help for command
  -R, --repo [HOST/]OWNER/REPO   Select another repository using the [HOST/]OWNER/REPO format

EXAMPLES
  # Watch a run until it's done
  $ gh run watch
  
  # Watch a run in compact mode
