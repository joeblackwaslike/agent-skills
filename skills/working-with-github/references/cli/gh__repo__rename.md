Rename a GitHub repository.

`<new-name>` is the desired repository name without the owner.

By default, the current repository is renamed. Otherwise, the repository specified
with `--repo` is renamed.

To transfer repository ownership to another user account or organization,
you must follow additional steps on `github.com`.

For more information on transferring repository ownership, see:
<https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository>
