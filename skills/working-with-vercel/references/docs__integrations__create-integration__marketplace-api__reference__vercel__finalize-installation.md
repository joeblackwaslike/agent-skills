# Finalize Installation

```http
POST /v1/installations/{integrationConfigurationId}/billing/finalize
```

This endpoint allows the partner to mark an installation as finalized. This means you will not send any more invoices for the installation. Use this after a customer has requested uninstall and you have sent any remaining invoices. This will allow the uninstall process to proceed immediately after all invoices have been paid. <br/> Use the `credentials.access_token` we provided in the [Upsert Installation](#upsert-installation) body to authorize this request.
