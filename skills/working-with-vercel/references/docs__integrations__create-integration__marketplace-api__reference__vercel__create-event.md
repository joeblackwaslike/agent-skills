# Create Event

```http
POST /v1/installations/{integrationConfigurationId}/events
```

Partner notifies Vercel of any changes made to an Installation or a Resource. Vercel is expected to use `list-resources` and other read APIs to get the new state.<br/> <br/> `resource.updated` event should be dispatched when any state of a resource linked to Vercel is modified by the partner.<br/> `installation.updated` event should be dispatched when an installation's billing plan is changed via the provider instead of Vercel.<br/> <br/> Resource update use cases: <br/> <br/> - The user renames a database in the partner’s application. The partner should dispatch a `resource.updated` event to notify Vercel to update the resource in Vercel’s datastores.<br/> - A resource has been suspended due to a lack of use. The partner should dispatch a `resource.updated` event to notify Vercel to update the resource's status in Vercel's datastores.<br/>
