## Troubleshooting views

You can use the following views on your dashboard to troubleshoot a build:

- **Build** logs - the console output when your deployment is building which can be found under the Deployment Status section of the Project's Deployment page.
- **Resources** tab - the functions, middleware, and assets from your deployment's build.
- **Source** tab - the output of the build after the deployment is successful. This can also be accessed by appending `/_src` to the Deployment URL

You can navigate to these views from the Deployment page by clicking on the **Source** tab, the **Resources** tab or the **Build Logs** accordion as shown below.

## Troubleshoot Build failures

If your build fails, Vercel will report the error message on the **Deployments** page so that you can investigate and fix the underlying issue.

In the following we show you how to look up the error message of your failed build.

### Investigating Build logs

[Build logs](/docs/deployments/logs) provide you with an insight into what happened during the build of a deployment and can be accessed by:

1. From your Vercel [dashboard](/dashboard), select the project and then [**Deployments**](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%5Bproject%5D%2Fdeployments\&title=Go+to+Deployments) in the sidebar
2. Select the deployment. When there are build issues you will notice an error status next to deployment name

![Image](`/docs-assets/static/docs/concepts/deployments/build-error-deploy-overview-page-02-1.png`)

3. On the errored deployment's page, you will see a summary of the error in the preview section. In the **Deployment Details** section, expand the **Building** accordion to expand the logs.
   There are situations where [build logs are not available](#build-logs-not-available), in this scenario the error will be presented in the UI instead.

4. Scroll down in the build logs until you find a red section where the keyword **"Error"** is mentioned.
   It can be mentioned once or multiple times.
   In many cases, the last mention is not indicative like in the example below where it says **`yarn run build exited with 1`**.
   If you look a few lines above, you will see an additional error which in this case indicates where the problem is with a link for more details. Sometimes, an error may not be mentioned in the lines above but the output will often help you identify where the problem is.

![Image](`/docs-assets/static/docs/concepts/deployments/build-error-deploy-overview-page-03.png`)

It is recommended to build your project on your local machine first (the build command varies per project) before deploying on Vercel. This will catch issues specific to your code or to your project's dependencies. In the example above, when the command `npm run build` (that runs `next build`) is run in the local console for a Next.js project, the error happens after building locally.

### Build Logs not available

Builds can fail without providing any build logs when Vercel detects a missing precondition that prevents a build from starting. For example:

- An invalid [`vercel.json` configuration](/docs/project-configuration) was committed
- When using [Ignored Build Steps](/kb/guide/how-do-i-use-the-ignored-build-step-field-on-vercel)
- Commits were made from a contributor that is not a [team member](/docs/rbac)

In this case, you cannot access the **Building** accordion described above, and instead, Vercel will present an overlay that contains the error message.

## Cancelled Builds due to limits

Sometimes, your Deployment Build can hit platform limits so that the build will be cancelled and throw a corresponding error that will be shown in the Build logs. Review the limits below in case you run into them.

### Build container resources

Every build container has a fixed amount of resources available to it. You can find the resources available for each build machine type [here](/docs/builds/managing-builds#larger-build-machines).

By default, the system generates this report only when it detects a problem. To receive a report for every deployment, set `VERCEL_BUILD_SYSTEM_REPORT=1` as an [environment variable](/docs/environment-variables#creating-environment-variables).

This report helps you detect hidden Out of Memory (OOM) events, and provides insights into disk usage by breaking down the sizes of your source code, `node_modules`, and output, and flagging files over 100 MB. The input size in the report corresponds to the size of your checked-out repository or files uploaded by CLI. The `node_modules` size represents the total size of all `node_modules` folders on disk.

| Resource         | Allocation  | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Memory           | 8192 MB     | Fixed memory allocation. Builds exceeding this limit will be cancelled                                                                                         |
| CPUs             | 4           | Number of CPUs allocated for build processing                                                                                                                  |
| Disk Space       | 32 GB       | Fixed disk space allocation. Builds exceeding this limit will be cancelled                                                                                     |
| System Report    | Conditional | Generated in [Build logs](/docs/deployments/logs) when memory or disk space limits are reached. Available by default                                           |
| Forced Reporting | Optional    | Set `VERCEL_BUILD_SYSTEM_REPORT=1` as an [environment variable](/docs/environment-variables#creating-environment-variables) to enable reporting for all builds |

Review the below steps to help navigate this situation:

- Review what package the error is related to and explore the package's documentation to see if the memory allocation can be customized with an install or Build command
- If no package is specified, look into reducing the amount of JavaScript that your Project might be using or find a more efficient JavaScript bundler
- Review what you are importing in your code such as third-party services, icons and media files

### Build duration

The total build duration is shown on the Vercel Dashboard and includes all three steps: building, checking, and assigning domains. Each step also shows the individual duration.

A Build can last for a maximum of 45 minutes. If the build exceeds this time, the deployment will be canceled and the error will be shown on the Deployment's Build logs. If you run into this limit, review this [guide](/kb/guide/how-do-i-reduce-my-build-time-with-next-js-on-vercel) that explains how to reduce the Build time with a Next.js Project.

### Caching

The maximum size of the Build's cache is 1 GB. It is retained for one month and it applies at the level of each [Build cache key](#caching-process).

It is not possible to manually configure which files are cached at this time.

## Other Build errors

You may come across the following Build-specific errors when deploying your Project. The link for each error provides possible causes of the error that can help you troubleshoot.

- [Missing Build script](/docs/errors/error-list#missing-build-script)
- [Recursive invocation of commands](/docs/errors/error-list#recursive-invocation-of-commands)
- [Pnpm engine unsupported](/docs/errors/error-list#pnpm-engine-unsupported)

A 'module not found' error is a syntax error that will appear at build time. This error appears when the static import statement cannot find the file at the declared path. For more information, see [How do I resolve a 'module not found' error?](/kb/guide/how-do-i-resolve-a-module-not-found-error)

## Troubleshoot Build time

### Understanding Build cache

The first Build in a Project will take longer as the Build cache is initially empty. Subsequent builds that have the same [Build cache key](#caching-process) will take less time because elements from your build, such as [framework files and node modules](#what-is-cached), will be reused from the available cache. The next sections will describe the factors that affect the Build cache to help you decrease the Build time

### What is cached

Vercel caches files based on the [Framework Preset](/docs/builds/configure-a-build#framework-preset) selected in your [Project settings](/docs/projects#project-settings). The following files are cached in addition to `node_modules/**`:

Note that the framework detection is dependent on the preset selection made in the [Build settings](/docs/builds/configure-a-build#build-and-development-settings). You should make sure that the correct framework is set for your project for optimum build caching.

### Caching process

At the beginning of each build, the previous Build's cache is restored prior to the [Install Command](/docs/builds/configure-a-build#install-command) or [Build command](/docs/builds/configure-a-build#build-command) executing. Each deployment is associated with a unique Build cache key that is derived from the combination of the following data:

- [Personal Account](/docs/accounts#creating-a-personal-account) or [Team](/docs/accounts)
- [Project](/docs/projects)
- [Framework Preset](/docs/builds/configure-a-build#framework-preset)
- [Root Directory](/docs/builds/configure-a-build#root-directory)
- [Node.js Version](/docs/functions/runtimes/node-js#node.js-version)
- [Package Manager](/docs/builds/configure-a-build#install-command)
- [Git branch](/docs/git)

Let's say that under your account `MyTeam`, you have a project `MySite` that is connected to your Git repository `MyCode` on the `main` branch for the production environment. When you make a commit to the `main` branch for the first time, you trigger a build that creates a production deployment with a new unique cache key. For any new commits to the `main` branch of `MyCode`, the existing Build cache is used as long as `MySite` is under `MyTeam`.

If you create a new Git branch in `MyCode` and make a commit to it, there is no cache for that specific branch. In this case, the last [production Deployment](/docs/deployments/environments#production-environment) cache is used to create a preview deployment and a new branch cache is created for subsequent commits to the new branch.

If you use [Vercel functions](/docs/functions) to process HTTP requests in your project, each Vercel Function is built separately in the Build step and has its own cache, based on the [Runtime](/docs/functions/runtimes) used. Therefore, the number and size of Vercel functions will affect your Build time. For Next.js projects, Vercel functions are bundled to optimize Build resources as described [here](/docs/functions/configuring-functions/advanced-configuration#bundling-vercel-functions).

At the end of each Build step, successful builds will update the cache and failed builds will **not modify** the existing cache.

### Excluding development dependencies

Since development dependencies (for example, packages such as `webpack` or `Babel`) are not needed in production, you may want to prevent them from being installed when deploying to Vercel to reduce the Build time. To skip development dependencies, customize the [Install Command](/docs/builds/configure-a-build#install-command) to be `npm install --only=production` or `yarn install --production`.

## Managing Build cache

Sometimes, you may not want to use the Build cache for a specific deployment. You can invalidate or delete the existing Build cache in the following ways:

- Use the **Redeploy** button for the specific deployment in the Project's [Deployments](/docs/deployments/managing-deployments) page. In the popup window that follows, leave the checkbox **Use existing Build Cache** unchecked. See [Redeploying a project](/docs/deployments/managing-deployments#redeploy-a-project) for more information.
- Use [`vercel --force`](/docs/cli/deploy#force) with [Vercel CLI](/docs/cli) to build and deploy the project **without** the Build cache
- Use an Environment Variable `VERCEL_FORCE_NO_BUILD_CACHE` with a value of `1` on your project to skip the Build cache
- Use an Environment Variable `TURBO_FORCE` with a value of `true` on your project to skip Turborepo [Remote Cache](/docs/monorepos/remote-caching)
- Use the `forceNew` optional query parameter with a value of `1` when [creating a new deployment with the Vercel API](/docs/rest-api/deployments/create-a-new-deployment) to skip the Build cache

> **💡 Note:** When redeploying **without** the existing Build Cache, the Remote Cache from
> [Turborepo](https://turborepo.com/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) and
> [Nx](https://nx.app/) are automatically excluded.
