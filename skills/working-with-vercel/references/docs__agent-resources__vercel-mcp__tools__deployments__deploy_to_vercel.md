# deploy_to_vercel

Deploy a small, simple project from inline file contents only when the Vercel CLI is unavailable and no usable remote git repository exists, or the user explicitly requests an inline file deployment. Prefer the Vercel CLI for local projects. It reads and uploads files directly without reproducing source as model output. If the intended source is pushed to a repository's production branch, use create\_git\_project. Do not reconstruct medium or large projects, binary assets, or dependency trees in tool arguments. This remote tool cannot read local paths or attachments. Files with actual contents are required. Limits: 300 files, 3 MiB per file, 4 MiB total encoded contents. Creation is asynchronous. Poll get\_deployment until READY, ERROR, or CANCELED before reporting the build outcome.

## Parameters

| Parameter         | Type             | Required | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | -------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `target`          | string           | Yes      | -       | Required. "preview" for a shareable non-production URL, or "production" to go live. Allowed values: `"preview"`, `"production"`.                                                                                           |
| `name`            | string           | Yes      | -       | Project name. Vercel creates the project if it does not already exist.                                                                                                                                                     |
| `files`           | Array\<object> | Yes      | -       | Required non-empty array of source files with their actual contents. A project name or local path alone cannot deploy. Do not include node\_modules, .git, .env files, or secrets. Vercel installs dependencies and builds. |
| `teamId`          | string           | No       | -       | The team ID or slug. Use the team that owns the resource.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `projectSettings` | object           | No       | -       | Optional build settings. Omit to let Vercel auto-detect the framework.                                                                                                                                                     |

This workflow is available on root connections that expose `deploy_to_vercel`. Project-scoped connections do not register it. Use `create_deployment` when your scoped connection exposes that tool.
