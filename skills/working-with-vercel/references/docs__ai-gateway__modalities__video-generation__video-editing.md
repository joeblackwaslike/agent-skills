# Video Editing

Edit existing videos using text prompts. Describe the changes you want and the model modifies the video accordingly.

Every model here also runs as a background job instead of one long-lived request. See [asynchronous generation](#asynchronous-generation) below.

## Grok Imagine Video

Grok Imagine Video (by SpaceXAI) can edit existing videos using text prompts. Provide a source video URL and describe the desired edits.

[Browse the latest Grok video models](/ai-gateway/models?capabilities=video-generation\&providers=xai) on the AI Gateway Models page.

> **💡 Note:** Video editing output matches the input video's aspect ratio and resolution,
> capped at 720p. A 1080p input will be downsized to 720p. The `duration`,
> `aspectRatio`, and `resolution` parameters are not supported for editing.

### Grok parameters

| Parameter                            | Type     | Required | Description                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `prompt`                             | `string` | Yes      | Description of the edits to apply to the video       |
| `providerOptions.xai.videoUrl`       | `string` | Yes      | URL of the source video to edit                      |
| `providerOptions.xai.pollIntervalMs` | `number` | No       | How often to check task status. Defaults to `5000`   |
| `providerOptions.xai.pollTimeoutMs`  | `number` | No       | Maximum wait time. Defaults to `600000` (10 minutes) |

### Grok example

```typescript filename="video-editing.ts"
import { experimental_generateVideo as generateVideo } from 'ai';
import fs from 'node:fs';

const result = await generateVideo({
  model: 'xai/grok-imagine-video',
  prompt: 'Give the person sunglasses and a hat',
  providerOptions: {
    xai: {
      videoUrl: 'https://example.com/source-video.mp4',
      pollTimeoutMs: 600000,
    },
  },
});

fs.writeFileSync('output.mp4', result.videos[0].uint8Array);
```

> **💡 Note:** Video generation can take several minutes. Set `pollTimeoutMs` to at least 10
> minutes (600000ms) for reliable operation. Generated video URLs are ephemeral
> and should be downloaded promptly.

## Asynchronous generation

Pass a `webhook` factory and the SDK registers your URL with the job instead of polling for it. The factory returns that URL and a `received` promise it waits on, then it fetches the videos itself.

```typescript filename="async-video-editing.ts"
const result = await generateVideo({
  model: gateway.videoModel('xai/grok-imagine-video'),
  prompt: 'Give the person sunglasses and a hat',
  providerOptions: {
    xai: {
      // Already a hosted URL, which is what the asynchronous flow needs.
      videoUrl: 'https://example.com/source-video.mp4',
    },
  },
  webhook: async () => ({
    url: callbackUrl,
    received: waitForDelivery(token),
  }),
  poll: { timeoutMs: 10 * 60 * 1000 },
});
```

The start request AI Gateway persists is capped at 300 KiB, so pass your source video as a hosted URL on this flow rather than inline data.

`token`, `callbackUrl`, and `waitForDelivery` come from [webhook-driven completion](/docs/ai-gateway/modalities/video-generation#webhook-driven-completion), which also covers the receiver, signature verification, and the payload shape.
