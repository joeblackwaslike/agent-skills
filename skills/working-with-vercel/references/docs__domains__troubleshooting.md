- Is your domain [added](/docs/domains/working-with-domains/add-a-domain#add-and-configure-domain) to your Vercel project?
- Is your custom domain pointed to the provided Vercel `CNAME`/`A` record correctly? You can check it by using `dig [example.com]` in your Terminal.
- If you use the [nameservers method](/docs/domains/troubleshooting#configuring-nameservers-for-wildcard-domains) on your apex domain, please refer to your DNS provider's documentation for the exact instructions on how to change authoritative nameservers.
- Is the issue only local to you? Try to clear your browser cache, and flush DNS caches on your machine/network if possible.

## Misconfigured domain issues

When you add a domain to Vercel that you have purchased from a third-party DNS provider, you may see an **Invalid Configuration** alert. There are many reasons why this could be the case:

- You need to configure the [DNS](#common-dns-issues) records of your domain with your DNS provider so they can be used with your project. To resolve this, follow the steps to [configure your domain](/docs/domains/working-with-domains/add-a-domain#configure-the-domain).
- If your domain is in use by another Vercel account, you may be prompted to [verify access to the domain](/docs/domains/working-with-domains/add-a-domain#verify-domain-access) by adding a TXT record. This will not move the domain into your account, but will allow you to use it in your project.
- There was an issue generating the SSL certificate for your domain. The most common reason for this is [missing CAA records](#missing-caa-records). For information on other issues that may cause this, see the [common SSL certificate issues](#common-ssl-certificate-issues) section.
- You have configured [wildcard subdomains](/docs/domains/working-with-domains/add-a-domain#using-wildcard-domain) on your project, but Vercel can't manage their DNS challenges. Check your [nameservers or certificate validation delegation](#configuring-nameservers-for-wildcard-domains).

## Common DNS issues

Vercel is expecting either an `A` record or a `CNAME` record. In your Project Settings under the Domain page, you’ll find the precise `CNAME` or `A` record values tailored to your project and plan. Make sure to remove any outdated records from your DNS provider to prevent conflicts. Once your new records have been added, you can use the following commands on your Terminal to check the DNS records are correctly configured:

- `dig ns [domain]` to get a domain’s nameservers
- `dig a [apex domain e.g. example.com]` to get a domain’s `A` record
- `dig cname [subdomain e.g. www.example.com]` to get a domain’s `CNAME` record

If you prefer a non-command-line interface, you can use a free online tool, such as [Google Public DNS](https://dns.google/). If any of these results do not match what is expected, follow the steps to [configure your domain](/docs/domains/working-with-domains/add-a-domain#configure-the-domain).

### DNS record propagation times

DNS changes can take a while to propagate across the globe, depending on the previous DNS record TTL length. This may mean that certain regions can access your site as intended, while others wait until the DNS changes have reached them. Please allow some time for these changes to take effect.
Changes to standard DNS records (A, CNAME, TXT, etc.) typically propagate quicker, but changing a domain’s nameservers can take up to **24–48 hours** to fully propagate across the internet. During this time, different users may see different versions of your site depending on their local DNS caches. You can monitor this propagation using tools like [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org) or the [dig](/docs/domains/managing-dns-records#verifying-dns-records) command in your terminal.

For more information on [propagation times](/docs/domains/working-with-dns#dns-propagation) for nameservers and other DNS records, see "[How long will it take for my Vercel DNS records to update?](/kb/guide/how-long-to-update-dns-records)"

> **💡 Note:** Before changing your DNS records to point to Vercel, we recommend updating
> your existing DNS record to "lower" the TTL (for example 60 seconds) and
> waiting for the old TTL to expire. Lowering the current TTL and changing a DNS
> record after its TTL expiration period can ensure that you can quickly roll
> back the change if you encounter an issue. You can then increase the DNS
> record TTL to its original value once you confirm everything is working as
> expected.

### IPv6 support

While we allow the [creation](/docs/domains/managing-dns-records#adding-dns-records) of AAAA records when using Vercel's nameservers, **we do not support IPv6 yet**. This means if you are adding a [custom domain](/docs/domains/working-with-domains/add-a-domain) from a [third-party](/docs/domains/working-with-domains#buying-a-domain-through-a-third-party), you won't be able to point an `AAAA` record to Vercel.

### Syntax errors debugging

When working with DNS records, you may make minor errors in the syntax. These errors can be difficult to debug. Below is a list of common errors made when adding DNS records and the steps required to resolve them.

#### Using the domain as part of the **Name** argument

When you add a new DNS record to a domain, the **Name** field should use the prefix or location of the record. For `www.example.com`, the name argument would be `www`.

If you have already added a record with this, [remove the record](/docs/domains/managing-dns-records#removing-dns-records) from the **DNS Records** section of the **Domains** tab, and add the record again **without** the domain as the **Name** argument.

#### Absolute CNAME records

When you add a custom domain with a subdomain to your project, we'll prompt you to add a CNAME DNS record to configure the domain. This record *includes* a period (.) at the end of the **Value** field. This is intentional to denote that it is an absolute, fully qualified domain name.

This means that when you add a new CNAME record to your DNS provider, you **must** copy the value exactly as it appears, **including** the period.

## Common Nameserver issues

### Configuring nameservers for wildcard domains

Wildcard certificates require DNS-01 validation. Vercel must be able to create a DNS record each time it issues or renews the certificate. Using [Vercel's nameservers](/docs/domains/working-with-domains/add-a-domain#vercel-nameservers) lets Vercel manage this automatically.

If you can't switch nameservers, you can delegate the appropriate `_acme-challenge` subdomain to Vercel and add a wildcard CNAME for traffic. Follow [Use wildcard domains with an external DNS provider](/docs/domains/working-with-domains/add-a-domain#use-wildcard-domains-with-an-external-dns-provider), which covers both records and the **Enable Vercel DNS** step while your existing DNS provider manages the rest of your records. For `*.example.com`, the challenge name is `_acme-challenge.example.com`; for `*.preview.example.com`, it is `_acme-challenge.preview.example.com`. Delegation can prevent another provider from issuing certificates that need the same challenge name.

## Common domain issues

### Domains and emails

When you buy a new domain, you may want to also set up an email address with this domain. Vercel **does not provide a mail service for domains purchased with or transferred into it**. To learn how to set up email, see [setting up email for your domain](/docs/domains/managing-dns-records#setting-up-email-for-your-domain)

When you add your custom domain to a project and use Vercel's nameservers, you will need to add `MX` records to continue receiving email. To learn how to add `MX` records, see
[troubleshooting email delivery](/docs/domains/managing-dns-records#troubleshooting-email-delivery)

### Purchasing a domain through Vercel

For eligible domain purchases, request a refund through the [support form](/help) within **four calendar days of the purchase timestamp**.

Some domain registries prohibit cancellations and refunds, even within the four-day window. Vercel Support can confirm whether your domain is eligible.

**Domain renewals are never refundable, for any TLD.** Registry policies make renewals final once processed, and Vercel Support cannot grant exceptions.

For a [free first-year domain](/docs/plans/pro-plan#free-first-year-domain-with-pro) claimed with a paid Pro plan, the domain renews at the standard rate after year one.

### Pending domain purchases

When a domain purchase does not go through immediately, your payment method may show a **temporary authorization**. This is a pending hold, not a completed charge. It will be automatically released by your bank if the domain is not successfully registered.

If the purchase is processing, your domain will appear in the [Domains tab](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Fdomains\&title=Domains+page) with a **“Pending”** status. Most purchases complete within minutes, but some TLDs may take up to 5 days to finalize. There is no need to retry the purchase or contact support while the domain is pending. You will receive a confirmation email once the registration completes.

### Pending verification

For domains registered through Vercel, open your team's **Domains** page, select the domain, and find **Registrant Information**. Update the contact details, select **Save**, and confirm that you can access the email address shown in the verification dialog. If this section is missing or the registry restricts changes, [contact support](/help).

Registrant contact details are verified automatically when the registrant email matches the Vercel user account or team Owner email. When the emails differ, you must verify the registrant email within **15 calendar days**. This period starts when registration completes or when you save a change to the registrant email.

Changing the registrant email sends a new verification email to the new address and starts a new 15-calendar-day verification period. If you no longer have access to the old address, update it here before requesting another email. Use **Resend** in the verification alert on the domain page, or the verification action in the project's **Settings** > **Domains** when shown.

If you don't complete the required verification within 15 calendar days, the registrar places the domain on `clientHold`. This suspends DNS resolution and takes the site offline until you confirm the registrant email address. These requirements apply to initial registrations and subsequent registrant contact changes.

Check the current domain status before dismissing an email. If the email and dashboard disagree, [contact support](/help).

### Emoji and ASCII support

To use a custom domain containing Unicode characters, such as accented letters or emoji, convert it to [Punycode](https://www.punycoder.com) before adding it to Vercel. Punycode represents Unicode domain names using ASCII characters.

If Vercel reports that the domain is not a fully qualified domain name, use the converted value in your project's [Domains settings](/docs/domains/working-with-domains/add-a-domain). For example, add `jérémie.fr` as `xn--jrmie-bsab.fr`.

### Unable to transfer-in a domain

[ICANN](https://www.icann.org/) forces domain registrars to wait **60 days**:

- between transfers
- between a new registration and a subsequent transfer

If you transfer before this time, the transfer will fail. Besides this restriction, some DNS providers may further restrict domain transferring by default as a security measure, unless the owner explicitly turns off their protection setting. Please refer to the DNS provider's documentation for more details.

### Working with Apex domain

When you add an [apex domain](/docs/domains/working-with-domains#subdomains-wildcard-domains-and-apex-domains) (e.g. `example.com`) to your project, Vercel provides you with details, including an IP address, to add as an `A` record in your DNS configuration, as opposed to a `CNAME` record.

The main reason for that is the DNS [RFC1034](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1034.txt) (section 3.6.2) states that `If a CNAME RR is present at a node, no other data should be present`. Because an apex domain requires `NS` records and usually some other records, such as `MX` (for a mail service), adding a `CNAME` at the zone apex would violate this rule and likely cause an issue on your domain. Therefore, we encourage you to use an `A` record at your zone apex instead.

### Domain IP address and geographic regions

When you configure an apex domain (example.com) as a custom domain for your project on Vercel, Vercel will be give you an IP address to add as an A record in your DNS configuration. Although this IP address resolves to a specific geographic location, it does not mean that when your users point to your domain, they will be sent to this specific geographic location to resolve the domain.

This is because Vercel uses [Anycast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anycast) IP addresses, which are shared across all regions. That means even if your users access your domain resolving to the same IP addresses from different geographic locations, they will be routed to the closest CDN region relative to your users, based on the BGP (Border Gateway Protocol).

### Domain ownership errors

When you add a domain to your project, Vercel checks if it is already associated with a [Personal Account or Team](/docs/accounts). A domain can only be associated with *one* Personal Account or Team at a time.

The following table shows errors that can be encountered when adding a domain to your project:

## Common SSL certificate issues

There are many reasons why a certificate may not be generated. As the first starting point, we recommend testing your domain with:

1. **[Let's Debug](https://letsdebug.net)**: Let's Debug is a diagnostic tool/website to help figure out why you might not be able to issue a certificate for Let's Encrypt
2. **[DNSViz](https://dnsviz.net/)**: DNSViz is a tool suite for analysis and visualization of Domain Name System (DNS) behavior, including its security extensions (DNSSEC). They can also tell you about possible DNS misconfiguration.

For non-wildcard domains, we use [HTTP-01](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#http-01-challenge) challenge by default, which Vercel handles automatically by intercepting the challenge requests from Let's Encrypt to your domain as long as the domain points to Vercel.

For wildcard domains, only [DNS-01](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#dns-01-challenge) is supported. Use Vercel nameservers or [delegate certificate validation](#configuring-nameservers-for-wildcard-domains) so Vercel can manage issuance and renewal.

### Check DNS and the HTTP challenge path

Confirm the hostname is added to your project's **Settings > Domains**, then compare its DNS response with the recommended records shown there:

```bash filename="terminal"
dig A example.com +short
dig AAAA example.com +short
dig CNAME www.example.com +short
curl -sS -D - -o /dev/null http://example.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/test-token
```

Unexpected DNS values can indicate stale or incorrect records, or a proxy in front of Vercel.

A made-up challenge token normally returns **404** because no matching challenge exists. Headers such as `server: Vercel` and `x-vercel-id` are evidence that the request reached Vercel, but don't prove a real validation will succeed. Proxies can forward or replace headers. Redirects, access-denied responses, or cached pages warrant checking the entire request path.

If you use a proxy, route `/.well-known/acme-challenge/*` to Vercel on port 80 without caching, authentication, rewrites, or proxy-level redirects. Alternatively, point DNS directly to Vercel; for Cloudflare, use **DNS only**. Follow the [reverse proxy requirements](/docs/security/reverse-proxy). Keep validation reachable for renewals as well as initial issuance.

### Resolve `ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR`

Compare the failing custom hostname with the deployment's generated `vercel.app` URL in the same browser. Generated URLs support HTTPS, but this doesn't mean each deployment has a separate certificate. If the generated URL works, investigate the custom hostname's DNS, certificate, and proxy configuration.

Try the same custom hostname on another device and network, such as a phone using cellular data. Success there suggests a network-specific issue, but DNS caches, IPv4/IPv6 routing, VPNs, and TLS inspection can also produce different results. Check the domain's status under **Settings > Domains** and resolve any certificate errors first.

If only a corporate or school network fails, ask its administrator to investigate filtering and TLS inspection. For a home or mobile network, contact the internet provider. If the error persists across networks or the certificate remains unavailable, contact [Vercel Support](/help) with the hostname, timestamps, browser error, DNS results, and results of these comparisons. Remove cookies, authorization headers, and other secrets from diagnostics.

### Missing `CAA` records

CAA records restrict which certificate authorities can issue certificates. Having no applicable CAA records doesn't itself block issuance. If your policy restricts issuers, authorize Let's Encrypt with `0 issue "letsencrypt.org"`. For wildcard certificates, an `issuewild` policy takes precedence over `issue`; it must also permit Let's Encrypt.

Check the hostname you need a certificate for:

```bash filename="terminal"
dig CAA www.example.com +noall +answer
dig CAA example.com +noall +answer
```

CAA lookups follow CNAME aliases. If a lookup returns no CAA records, the authority checks the parent of the original name, continuing upward until it finds a CAA policy. A closer policy takes precedence; policies at different levels aren't combined. See [RFC 8659](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8659.html#section-3). An empty answer for one hostname doesn't rule out an applicable parent policy, and DNS errors aren't equivalent to an empty answer.

#### Custom CAA with a Vercel CNAME

A CNAME can't coexist with a CAA record at the same hostname. When a CAA lookup follows your alias to a Vercel CNAME target, Vercel's CAA policy can apply. You can't customize that target's CAA records, and Vercel can't add your custom issuers there.

If you need a different authority for a multi-provider certificate or proxy, replace the CNAME with an **A record using the recommended IP address from your project's Settings > Domains**. Then add the required CAA records at that hostname or its applicable parent, including permission for Let's Encrypt if Vercel also issues certificates. Verify both A and CAA lookups after propagation. Changing CAA doesn't enable uploading custom certificates on plans that don't support it.

### Existing `_acme-challenge` record

An `_acme-challenge` record allows Let's Encrypt to verify the domain ownership using [DNS-01](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#dns-01-challenge) challenge. This may exist on your apex or subdomains, so can be checked with `dig -t TXT _acme-challenge.example.com` or `dig -t TXT _acme-challenge.subdomain.example.com`

If a previous provider left records at the challenge name, check whether they redirect DNS-01 validation away from Vercel. Update stale records only after checking their purpose. Keep NS records that intentionally [delegate validation to Vercel](/docs/domains/working-with-domains/add-a-domain#use-wildcard-domains-with-an-external-dns-provider); deleting them breaks wildcard certificate renewal.

### Rewriting or redirecting `/.well-known`

The [/.well-known](# "The /.well-known directory") path is reserved and cannot be redirected or rewritten. Only Enterprise teams can configure custom SSL. [Contact sales](/contact/sales) to learn more.
