## Hobby billing cycle

As the Hobby plan is a free tier there are no billing cycles. In most cases, if you exceed your usage limits on the Hobby plan, you will have to wait until 30 days have passed before you can use the feature again.

Some usage limits have shorter pause periods:

- [Web Analytics](/docs/analytics/limits-and-pricing#hobby): collection pauses
  after the grace period and can resume after 7 days

As stated in the [fair use guidelines](/docs/limits/fair-use-guidelines#commercial-usage), the Hobby plan restricts users to non-commercial, personal use only.

When your personal account gets converted to a Hobby team, your usage and activity log will be reset. To learn more about this change, read the [changelog](/changelog/2024-01-account-changes).

## Upgrading to Pro

You can take advantage of Vercel's Pro trial to explore [Pro features](/docs/plans/pro-plan) for free during the trial period, with some [limitations](/docs/plans/pro-plan/trials#trial-limitations).

The [free first-year domain offer](/docs/plans/pro-plan#free-first-year-domain-with-pro) is not available during the Pro trial. It applies to paid Pro teams: a team becomes eligible once it is on a paid Pro plan.

To upgrade from a Hobby plan:

1. Go to your [dashboard](/dashboard). If you're upgrading a team, make sure to select the team you want to upgrade
2. Open **Settings** in the sidebar and select [**Billing**](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Fsettings%2Fbilling\&title=Go+to+Billing)
3. Under **Plan**, if your team is eligible for an upgrade, you can click the **Upgrade** button. Or, you may need to create or select a team to upgrade. In that case, you can click **Create a Team** or **Upgrade a Team**
4. Optionally, add team members. Developer seats cost **$20 per user / month**, while Viewer seats are free
5. Enter your card details
6. Click **Confirm and Upgrade**

If you would like to end your paid plan, you can [downgrade to Hobby](/docs/plans/pro-plan#downgrading-to-hobby).
