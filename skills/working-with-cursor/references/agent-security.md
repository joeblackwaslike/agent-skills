# Agent Security

AI can behave unexpectedly due to prompt injection, hallucinations, and other issues. We protect users with guardrails that limit what agents can do. By default, sensitive actions require your manual approval. This document explains our guardrails and what they mean for you.

These controls and behaviors are our defaults. We recommend keeping them enabled.

## First-party tool calls

Cursor includes tools that help agents write code: reading files, editing files, running terminal commands, searching the web, and more.

Reading files and searching code don't require approval. Use [.cursorignore](https://cursor.com/docs/reference/ignore-file.md) to block agent access to specific files. Actions that could expose sensitive data require your explicit approval.

Agents can modify workspace files without approval, except for configuration files. Changes save immediately to disk. Always use version control so you can revert changes. Configuration files (like workspace settings) need your approval first.

**Warning:** If you have auto-reload enabled, agent changes might execute before you can review them.

By default, terminal commands need your approval. You can either enable a broader [Run Mode](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/tools/terminal.md#run-mode), or add them to your allowlist to get them to run without approval.

You can enable auto-approval if you accept the risk. On Cursor 3.6 and above, **Auto-review** is the recommended default. It runs allowlisted calls, sandboxes what it can, and sends anything else through an LLM classifier that decides allow or block based on safety and how well the call matches your intent. To see the step-by-step flow, read [how Auto-review decides](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/tools/terminal.md#how-auto-review-works). **Run Everything** runs every call without screening; pick it when you want zero prompting and no classifier in the loop. **Allowlist** and **Allowlist (with Sandbox)** are the older modes and rely on an [allowlist](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/tools/terminal.md#protection-settings) of terminal commands and MCP tools. All four modes are best-effort; bypasses are possible. Manage modes and allowlists in **Cursor Settings > Agents > Run Mode** or [`permissions.json`](https://cursor.com/docs/reference/permissions.md).

Cursor 3.6 adds **Auto-review** as the default Run Mode. Before Cursor 3.5, the older modes appeared as **Run in Sandbox**, **Ask Every Time**, and **Run Everything**.

## Third-party tool calls

You can connect external tools using [MCP](https://cursor.com/docs/mcp.md). All MCP connections need your approval. After you approve an MCP connection, each tool call still needs individual approval before running. You can pre-approve specific tools with an [MCP allowlist](https://cursor.com/docs/reference/permissions.md#mcp-allowlist-format).

## Network requests

Attackers could use network requests to steal data. Our tools only make network requests to:

- GitHub
- Direct link retrieval
- Web search providers

Agents cannot make arbitrary network requests with default settings.

## Workspace trust

Cursor supports [workspace trust](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editing/workspaces/workspace-trust), but it's disabled by default. When enabled, it prompts you to choose between normal or restricted mode for new workspaces. Restricted mode breaks AI features. For untrusted repos, use a basic text editor instead.

To enable workspace trust:

1. Open your user settings.json file
2. Add the following configuration:

   ```json
   "security.workspace.trust.enabled": true
   ```

Organizations can enforce this setting through MDM solutions.
