## Client Compatibility

Some MySQL features are client features, not server features. Dolt ships with a client (ie. [`dolt sql`](/cli-reference/cli#dolt-sql)) and a server ([`dolt sql-server`](/cli-reference/cli#dolt-sql-server)). The Dolt client is not as sophisticated as the `mysql` client. To access these features you can use the `mysql` client that ships with MySQL.

| Feature                         | Supported | Notes and limitations                                                                                    |
|:--------------------------------|:----------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SOURCE                          | ❌        | Works with Dolt via the `mysql` client                                                                    |
| LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE          | ❌        | LOAD DATA INFILE works with the Dolt client. The LOCAL option only works with Dolt via the `mysql` client |

## Join hints

Join hints let you override the planner's cost-based choice of join
order and join strategy for a single query. They use the Oracle-style
`/*+ ... */` comment syntax placed immediately after the `SELECT`
keyword:

```sql
SELECT /*+ JOIN_ORDER(pa, p, ib, obj, o, ik, ki) */ count(*)
FROM pa
JOIN p ON pa.id = p.pa_id
JOIN ib ON ib.p_id = p.id
...;
```

Hint names are case-insensitive, and arguments inside the parentheses
may be separated by commas, spaces, or both.

### Supported hints

| Hint                              | Args      | What it does                                                                                                                       |
|-----------------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `JOIN_ORDER(t1, t2, ...)`         | all tables in the join | Forces the planner to join the listed tables in that order. Must include every table named in the join scope.        |
| `LOOKUP_JOIN(t1, t2)`             | 2 tables  | Force a lookup join between `t1` and `t2`.                                                                                          |
| `LEFT_OUTER_LOOKUP_JOIN(t1, t2)`  | 2 tables  | Force a left-outer lookup join between `t1` and `t2`.                                                                               |
| `MERGE_JOIN(t1, t2)`              | 2 tables  | Force a merge join between `t1` and `t2`.                                                                                           |
| `NO_MERGE_JOIN`                   | none      | Disable merge joins for the entire query.                                                                                           |
| `HASH_JOIN(t1, t2)`               | 2 tables  | Force a hash join between `t1` and `t2`.                                                                                            |
| `INNER_JOIN(t1, t2)`              | 2 tables  | Force a non-physical inner join (lets the planner pick the physical operator but locks the inner-join shape) between `t1` and `t2`. |
| `SEMI_JOIN(t1, t2)`               | 2 tables  | Force a semi join (for `EXISTS` / `IN` rewrites) between `t1` and `t2`.                                                             |
| `ANTI_JOIN(t1, t2)`               | 2 tables  | Force an anti join (for `NOT EXISTS` / `NOT IN` rewrites) between `t1` and `t2`.                                                    |
| `LEFT_DEEP`                       | none      | Restrict the planner to left-deep join trees (the right child of every join is a single table).                                     |

Two hints are recognized by the parser but currently no-ops while
their implementations are pending: `JOIN_FIXED_ORDER` (would lock the
join order to the order tables appear in the `FROM` clause) and
`NO_ICP` (would disable index condition pushdown).

### Combining hints

Multiple hints are separated by whitespace inside the same comment.
You can use `JOIN_ORDER` alone, individual operator hints alone, or
combine the two — for example, to fix both the order and the strategy
at each join in a three-table query:

```sql
SELECT /*+ JOIN_ORDER(xy, uv, ab) LOOKUP_JOIN(xy, uv) HASH_JOIN(uv, ab) */ 1
FROM xy
JOIN uv ON x = u
JOIN ab ON a = u;
```

Join operator hints (`LOOKUP_JOIN`, `MERGE_JOIN`, etc.) match as long
as the two named tables are subsets of the join's left and right
inputs respectively, and the order of the two arguments doesn't
matter.

### Verifying a hint took effect

Hints are advisory: the planner applies them when it can and silently
falls back to default cost-based planning otherwise. The two ways a
hint gets ignored:

- **One of the hints in the comment is invalid.** Hints are applied as
  a set — if any one of them can't be satisfied (for example, a
  `JOIN_ORDER` that names a table not in the query, or a
  `MERGE_JOIN(a, b)` between two tables that don't have a usable
  equi-join predicate and indexes), **none of the hints in that
  comment are applied** and the engine falls back to default costing.
- **The hint contradicts a physical requirement.** A `MERGE_JOIN`
  needs sorted inputs (typically backed by indexes); a `LOOKUP_JOIN`
  needs an index on the right-side join key; etc. If those aren't
  available, the planner can't honor the hint.

Confirm a hint took effect with `EXPLAIN`:

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT /*+ JOIN_ORDER(pa, p, ib) HASH_JOIN(p, ib) */ count(*)
FROM pa
JOIN p ON pa.id = p.pa_id
JOIN ib ON ib.p_id = p.id;
```

The plan output names the chosen operator at each join node
(`HashJoin`, `MergeJoin`, `LookupJoin`, etc.) and the table on each
side, so you can read off whether the planner followed the hint.

## Table Statistics

### ANALYZE table

Dolt currently supports table statistics for index and join costing.

Statistics are auto-collected by default for servers, but can be manually collected by running `ANALYZE TABLE <table, ...>`.

Here is an example of how to initialize and observe statistics:

```sql
CREATE TABLE xy (x int primary key, y int);
INSERT INTO xy values (1,1), (2,2);
ANALYZE TABLE xy;
SELECT * from information_schema.tables;
+-------------+------------+-------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| SCHEMA_NAME | TABLE_NAME | COLUMN_NAME | HISTOGRAM                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
+-------------+------------+-------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| tmp4        | xy         | x           | {"statistic": {"avg_size": 0, "buckets": [{"bound_count": 1, "distinct_count": 2, "mcv_counts": [1,1], "mcvs": [[1],[2]], "null_count": 0, "row_count": 2, "upper_bound": [2]}], "columns": ["x"], "created_at": "2023-11-14T11:33:32.250178-08:00", "distinct_count": 2, "null_count": 2, "qualifier": "tmp4.xy.PRIMARY", "row_count": 2, "types:": ["int"]}} |
+-------------+------------+-------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

```sql
create table horses (id int primary key, name varchar(10), key(name));
insert into horses select x, 'Steve' from (with recursive inputs(x) as (select 1 union select x+1 from inputs where x < 1000) select * from inputs) dt;
analyze table horses;
select `index`, `position`, row_count, distinct_count, columns, upper_bound, upper_bound_cnt, mcv1 from dolt_statistics;
+---------+----------+-----------+----------------+----------+-------------+-----------------+-----------+
| index   | position | row_count | distinct_count | columns  | upper_bound | upper_bound_cnt | mcv1      |
+---------+----------+-----------+----------------+----------+-------------+-----------------+-----------+
| primary | 0        | 344       | 344            | ["id"]   | [344]       | 1               | [344]     |
| primary | 1        | 125       | 125            | ["id"]   | [469]       | 1               | [469]     |
| primary | 2        | 249       | 249            | ["id"]   | [718]       | 1               | [718]     |

| primary | 4        | 170       | 170            | ["id"]   | [1000]      | 1               | [1000]    |
| name    | 5        | 260       | 1              | ["name"] | ["Steve"]   | 260             | ["Steve"] |
| name    | 6        | 237       | 1              | ["name"] | ["Steve"]   | 237             | ["Steve"] |
| name    | 7        | 137       | 1              | ["name"] | ["Steve"]   | 137             | ["Steve"] |
| name    | 8        | 188       | 1              | ["name"] | ["Steve"]   | 188             | ["Steve"] |
| name    | 9        | 178       | 1              | ["name"] | ["Steve"]   | 178             | ["Steve"] |
+---------+----------+-----------+----------------+----------+-------------+-----------------+-----------+
```

### Disable

Some workloads, like batch imports, perform strictly better without the overhead of statistics collection. In these cases, we can explicitly stop or purge (stop + delete) statistics on a running server:

```sql
call dolt_stats_stop();
call dolt_stats_purge();
```

A stopped-stats server can be restarted, or have a single collection cycle performed by an operator:

```sql
call dolt_stats_restart();
call dolt_stats_once();
```

An environment variable can disable statistics on server reboots:

```sql
— on version 1.51.0 or higher
SET @@PERSIST.dolt_stats_enabled = 0;

— up to 1.50.x
SET @@PERSIST.dolt_stats_auto_refresh_enabled = 0;
```

A rebooted server with stats turned off has no reversal mechanism at the moment. All stats operations are no-ops
if a server starts with the above variables set.

### Auto-Refresh

Statistics automatically update for servers by default. Stats are stored in a database in `.dolt/stats` separate from user data. This folder can safely be deleted offline.

Stats throughput can be lowered by raising the the `dolt_stats_job_interval` variable, which indicates the milliseconds of delay between processing steps. The higher the delay and more branches in a database, the longer it will take for statistic updates to materialize. High delays reduce the fraction of runtime resources diverted to managing background statistics.

Stats can be disabled with the `dolt_stats_enabled=0` variable.

Stats persistence can be disabled with the `dolt_stats_memory_only=1` variable.

### Stats Garbage Collection

The stats in-memory cache accumulates new histograms proportionally to the write rate and stats update rate. Periodically, an
update cycle will swap the currently active histogram buckets to a new in-memory map and clear the old set.

Stats garbage collection can be disabled with the `dolt_stats_gc_enabled=0` variable.

Garbage collection frequency can be tuned with the `dolt_stats_gc_interval` variable (default 1 hour).

### Stats Controller Functions

Dolt exposes a set of helper procedures for managing statistics collection and use:

  - `dolt_stats_stop`: clear queue and disable thread
  - `dolt_stats_restart`: clear queue, refresh queue, start thread
  - `dolt_stats_purge`: clear queue, refresh queue, clear cache disable thread
  - `dolt_stats_once`: collect statistics once, ex: in sql-shell
  - `dolt_stats_wait`: block on a full queue cycle
  - `dolt_stats_gc`: block waiting for a GC signal
  - `dolt_stats_flush`: block waiting for a flush signal
  - `dolt_stats_info`: print the current state of the stats provider (optional `'-short'` flag)
