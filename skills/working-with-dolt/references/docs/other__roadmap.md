Roadmap last updated Aug 2026, next update Oct 2026.

## Major releases in 2026

[Dolt 2.0](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2026-05-11-dolt-2-dot-0/) launched in May. It is the second
major-version release of the database, and represents a new level of performance, features, and
stability for our growing pool of production server customers.

[Doltgres 1.0](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2026-08-06-doltgres-1-0/) launched in August. Doltgres
is the Postgres-compatible version of Dolt. This launch signals that Doltgres has achieved a level
of compatibility and stability comparable to Dolt's 1.0 release and is ready for production use
cases. Try it and let us know what you think.

## Upcoming features

Work to improve the performance and availability of Dolt and Doltgres is a constant theme and not
called out explicitly unless it's a major separable effort.
