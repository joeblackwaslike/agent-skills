Full details on [supported SQL
features](/sql-reference/sql-support/) are
available on the docs site.

This is a selection of unimplemented features we're working on. Don't
see what you need on here? [Let us
know!](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/issues) Paying customers get
their feature requests implemented first.

Our biggest announcement this year is the [Beta release of
Doltgres](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-04-16-doltgres-goes-beta/), which means we think it's
ready to start building production applications. Try it and let us know what you think.

Roadmap last updated Oct 2025, next update Jan 2026.
