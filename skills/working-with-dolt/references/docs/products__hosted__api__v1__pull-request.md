# Pull Request

Proposals to merge one branch into another within a deployment's database. Merging itself is done in the Hosted web UI, not through this API.

## List a database's pull requests {#listDeploymentPulls}
<span class="api-method" style="background:#29E3C1">GET</span> <code class="api-path">/api/v1/deployments/{owner}/{deployment}/pulls</code>

Returns the pull requests for one database in `{owner}/{deployment}`, newest first.

Pull requests belong to a deployment but are scoped to a database within it, so `database` is required — a deployment can host several, and their pull requests are unrelated.

Merging is not part of this API. Merge a pull request in the Hosted web UI; `state` here reports the result.

Pages hold up to 20 pull requests and the size is not caller-controlled. Do not infer the end of the list from how many came back — a full page can still be the last one. `meta.next_page_token` is the only signal that there is more, and its absence is the only signal that there is not.


**Parameters**

| Name | In | Type | Required | Description |
|------|----|------|----------|-------------|
| `owner` | path | string | yes | The user or organization that owns the deployment. 3–32 characters of letters, digits, hyphens, and underscores. |
| `deployment` | path | string | yes | The deployment name, unique within the owner. 3–32 characters of letters, digits, hyphens, and underscores. |
| `database` | query | string | yes | The database within the deployment whose pull requests to list. |
| `state` | query | [`PullState`](/products/hosted/api/v1/models#model-pullstate) | no | Return only pull requests in this state. All states when omitted. |
| `query` | query | string | no | Free-text filter matched as a substring against the pull request's title and its creator's username, case-insensitively. Matched literally: it is not a pattern, and characters with meaning in SQL patterns carry none here. |
| `page_token` | query | string | no | The `next_page_token` from a previous response. Opaque — do not construct or parse it. |

**Example request**

```sh
curl -X GET 'https://hosted.doltdb.com/api/v1/deployments/{owner}/{deployment}/pulls?database=inventory' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN'
```
