## How it works

In some cases you might want to clone your database from Hosted so that you can access
Dolt's [command line interface](/cli-reference/cli). While much of the command line is
[available in SQL](/sql-reference/version-control/) there are some
CLI-specific features that can be helpful for debugging your database offline.

In order to clone from Hosted, we needed to add support for exposing the databases on a
Hosted sql-server as a read-only remotesapi endpoint. When you run sql-server with this
configuration, it will:

1. Listen on an indicated port and serve read-only remotesapi traffic on that port
2. Use any server-side TLS associated with the sql-server itself as part of that listener
3. Use the deployment's user and password in the sql-server config as password
   authentication credentials for accessing the exposed data

Once you allow the remotesapi to be exposed for your Hosted deployment (available only for
deployments with Web PKI certificates), you can simply set a `DOLT_REMOTE_PASSWORD`
environment variable and provide a username to the `dolt clone` command. You'll see these
instructions in the Connectivity tab of your deployment page.

## Example

When you're using Hosted as your production database, there might be some
performance-heavy operations or tests you want to run in isolation so you don't impact
production, such as beta testing a considerable schema migration or running a big
analytics query. [Clone](/cli-reference/cli#dolt-clone) makes it easy to get a local
copy of your Hosted database with one command. Do whatever potentially destructive or
performance-degrading operations on your laptop while respecting your production database.

## 1. Expose remotesapi endpoint

In order to enable cloning from your Hosted database, first expose the [remotesapi
endpoint](/cli-reference/cli#dolt-sql-server). This will set the port for a server
which can expose the databases in the sql-server over remotesapi.

**Note that this will only work for deployments that use a Web PKI certificate.**

Check both the "Use Web PKI Certificate" and "Expose remotesapi endpoint" when creating a
deployment will also work.

## 2. Set remote password and run clone command with user flag

To authenticate against it, you have to set a `DOLT_REMOTE_PASSWORD` environment variable
and pass along a `--user` flag to the `dolt clone` command. You can find these
instructions in the Connectivity tab on your deployment page.

If you'd like to allow other SQL users to clone without giving them access to your Hosted
admin username and password, you can grant them `CLONE_ADMIN` privileges.

```sql
CREATE USER "[username]"@"[host]" IDENTIFIED BY "[password]";
GRANT CLONE_ADMIN ON *.* TO "[username]"@"[host]";
```

A few things worth calling out, since they trip people up:

- **The SQL user has to exist first.** Hosted account collaborators (the people you add
  on the deployment's Settings tab) are a separate namespace from the SQL users on the
  database itself — adding someone as a collaborator does not create a SQL user for them.
  Run the `CREATE USER` above, then share that username and password with them.
- **`CLONE_ADMIN` covers the whole local-clone workflow, not just `dolt clone`.** Despite
  the name, granting it lets the user clone the database, `fetch`/`pull` updates, *and*
  push new branches up to the deployment — everything needed to prepare a pull request
  from a local copy. It does not let them push to a branch they don't have write access
  to (see [Branch permissions](#branch-permissions) below). The end-to-end flow runs
  through sections 2–5 below: clone, sync, push a feature branch, open a PR.

After running the `dolt clone` command, you should have a local copy of your Hosted
database.

```shell
% dolt clone https://dolthub-us-housing.dbs.hosted.doltdb.com/us-housing-prices --user "username"
cloning https://dolthub-us-housing.dbs.hosted.doltdb.com/us-housing-prices
% cd us-housing-prices
% dolt sql -q "select count(*) from sales"
+----------+
| count(*) |
+----------+
| 13844603 |
+----------+
```

## 3. Sync your local copy with upstream changes

Now we can run whatever queries or schema migrations we want without affecting production.
If there are updates to the database, easily sync your local copy using [`dolt
fetch`](/cli-reference/cli#dolt-fetch) or [`dolt
pull`](/cli-reference/cli#dolt-pull).

Assuming your password environment variable is still set, you can authenticate these
commands to your remotesapi endpoint in the same way by passing the `--user` flag:

```shell
% dolt pull --user "[username]"
% dolt fetch --user "[username]"
```

## 4. Sync your upstream with changes from local copy

If you make any changes on your local copy, you can push them to your upstream using
[`dolt push`](/cli-reference/cli#dolt-push). Push to a feature branch rather than
straight to `main` so that your change can be reviewed via a pull request before it
lands — see the next section.

```shell
% dolt checkout -b my-change
% # ...edit, dolt add, dolt commit...
% dolt push origin --user "[username]" HEAD:my-change
```

You can also push straight to `main` if you'd rather skip review, subject to any
[branch permissions](#branch-permissions) configured on the deployment:

```shell
% dolt push origin --user "[username]" HEAD:main
```

## 5. Open a pull request

Hosted Dolt doesn't have forks — that's a DoltHub and DoltLab feature. To contribute
a change for review, push a feature branch to the deployment (as in step 4 above) and
then open the pull request from the **workbench**: open the deployment's Workbench
tab, click into the database, go to the **Pull Requests** tab, and click
**Create Pull Request**. Pick your branch as the "from" branch and `main` (or wherever)
as the "to" branch. The detailed workbench flow is documented in
[Creating a pull request](/products/hosted/sql-workbench#5-creating-a-pull-request).

Pull requests on Hosted can only be opened and merged from the web workbench — the
SQL/CLI surface doesn't expose a "create PR" operation today. The push itself can come
from anywhere (CLI, agent, automation); only the PR ceremony is web-only.

That split exists because pull requests are an artifact of the workbench, not part of
the Dolt database itself — the same distinction as GitHub PRs vs. Git branches. The
branches and commits a PR proposes are real Dolt objects and travel with the database
if you clone it; the PR itself (title, description, comments, open/merged state) is
workbench metadata and stays behind.

## Branch permissions

If you want some collaborators to be able to push feature branches but not push to
`main` (the most common reason to set up CLONE_ADMIN users in the first place), the
Workbench tab has a Branch Permissions UI that lets you scope who can write to which
branch patterns. The launch blog covers the model and the UI:
[Hosted Branch Permissions](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2026-03-12-hosted-branch-permissions/).
