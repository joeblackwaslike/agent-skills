## General system setting variables

### `dbname_default_branch`

This system variable controls a database's default branch, defaulting to the checked out branch when
the server started. For a database named `mydb`, this variable will be named
`mydb_default_branch`. New sessions will connect to this branch by default.

### `dolt_log_level`

This system variable controls logging levels in the server. Valid values are `error`, `warn`,
`info`, `debug`, or `trace`. This value overrides whatever was specified on the command line for
`dolt sql-server` or in the `config.yaml` file.

### `dolt_show_branch_databases`

When set to `1`, this system variable causes all branches to be
represented as separate databases in `show databases`, the
`information_schema` tables, and other places where databases are
enumerated. Defaults to `0`, which means that by default
branch-derived databases are not displayed (although they can still be
used).

```sql
fresh> show databases;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| fresh              |
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
+--------------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)

fresh> set @@dolt_show_branch_databases = 1;
fresh> show databases;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| fresh              |
| fresh/b1           |
| fresh/main         |
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
+--------------------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

### `dolt_show_system_tables`

When set to `1`, this system variable causes all system tables to be shown in `show tables` and in `information_schema.tables`.
Defaults to `0`.

### `dolt_override_schema`

When set to a commit hash, branch name, or tag name, Dolt will map all table data to the schema at the specified commit,
branch, or tag. This is useful when you have a query that runs with a specific schema, and you want to run it with
data that has a different schema. For example, if you add a `Birthdate` column to the `People` table in the most recent commits
in your database, you cannot reference that column in queries run against older commits. If you enable schema overriding, and
set `@@dolt_override_schema` to a commit that contains the `Birthdate` column, you can run the same query with recent
commits and with older commits, without having to modify the query for the schema changes in the older commits. Dolt will
map the table data to the schema at the specified commit, branch, or tag, and fill in the missing columns with `NULL` values.

```sql
-- check out an older branch that has a different schema
CALL dolt_checkout('olderBranch');

-- running a query that references the Birthdate column will fail
SELECT Name, Birthdate FROM People;
column "Birthdate" could not be found in any table in scope

-- turning on schema overriding allows us to automatically map our data to the schema at the specified commit
SET @@dolt_override_schema = 'main';
SELECT Name, Birthdate FROM People;
+-----------+-----------+
| Name      | Birthdate |
+-----------+-----------+
| Billy     | NULL      |
| Jimbo     | NULL      |
+-----------+-----------+
```

Note that when this session variable is set, the active Dolt session becomes read-only. To disable schema overriding,
simply set this variable to `NULL`.

### `dolt_transaction_commit`

When set to `1`, this system variable creates a Dolt commit for every
SQL transaction commit. Defaults to `0`. Commits have a standard commit
message ("Transaction commit"), unless `@@dolt_transaction_commit_message` has been set.

### `dolt_transaction_commit_message`

When `@@dolt_transaction_commit` is enabled, if this system variable is set to a
non-empty string, it will be used as the message for the automatic Dolt commit. Defaults to the
empty string, which means automatic Dolt commits will use their standard commit message
("Transaction commit"). Scope: both global and session.

### `strict_mysql_compatibility`

When set to `1`, Dolt will disable some extensions to MySQL behavior that are intended to increase compatibility
with other database engines in the MySQL family. For example, for compatibility with MariaDB, Dolt supports an
extension to MySQL's behavior that allows `TEXT` and `BLOB` columns to be used in unique indexes without specifying
a prefix length. Users who want Dolt to behave exactly like MySQL and not support these extensions can set this
system variable to `1`. For wider compatibility, this system variable defaults to `0` to enable these extensions
by default.

### `dolt_allow_commit_conflicts`

When set to `1`, this system variable allows transactions with merge
conflicts to be committed. When set to `0`, merge conflicts must be
resolved before committing a transaction, and attempting to commit a
transaction with conflicts fails and rolls back the
transaction. Defaults to `0`.

### `dolt_commit_verification_groups`

When set, this system variable enables commit verification by running tests from the [`dolt_tests`](/sql-reference/version-control/dolt-system-tables#dolt_tests) system table before allowing [commits](/sql-reference/version-control/dolt-sql-procedures#dolt_commit), [merges](/sql-reference/version-control/dolt-sql-procedures#dolt_merge), [cherry-picks](/sql-reference/version-control/dolt-sql-procedures#dolt_cherry_pick), and [rebase](/sql-reference/version-control/dolt-sql-procedures#dolt_rebase) operations. The variable specifies which test groups to run:

- `"*"` - Run all tests in the `dolt_tests` table
- `"group1,group2,group3"` - Run tests from specific test groups (comma-separated)
- `NULL` or empty - Disable commit verification (default)

The `--skip-verification` flag can be used to bypass verification.

```sql
-- Enable commit verification for all tests
SET @@PERSIST.dolt_commit_verification_groups = '*';

-- Enable for specific test groups only
SET @@PERSIST.dolt_commit_verification_groups = 'unit,integration';

-- Disable commit verification
SET @@PERSIST.dolt_commit_verification_groups = NULL;

-- Example: commit will fail if tests fail
INSERT INTO dolt_tests VALUES ('test_count', 'unit', 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users', 'expected_single_value', '==', '5');
CALL dolt_commit('-m', 'Add user data'); -- Will run tests first

-- Example: bypass verification for this operation
CALL dolt_commit('--skip-verification', '-m', 'Emergency fix');
```

### `dolt_force_transaction_commit`

When set to `1`, this system variable ignores all merge conflicts,
constraint violations, and other correctness issues resulting from a
merge and allows them to be committed. Defaults to `0`.

### `dolt_dont_merge_json`

When set to `1`, Dolt will not attempt to automatically merge concurrent changes to the same JSON document, and will instead report the merge as having conflicts which must manually be resolved. Use this if your JSON requires invariants that could be violated if two commits make concurrent changes to different locations in the same document. Defaults to `0`.

### `dolt_allow_ci_creation`

Gates creation of [Dolt continuous integration](/products/dolthub/continuous-integration) workflows on this server. When set to `1`, a session may create the `dolt_ci_*` workflow tables (for example via `dolt ci init`); when `0` (the default), workflow creation is rejected. Session-scoped boolean.

### `dolt_auto_gc_enabled`

When set to `1` (the default), the server automatically garbage-collects unreferenced data in the background, so you don't have to run [`dolt_gc()`](/sql-reference/version-control/dolt-sql-procedures#dolt_gc) by hand. This is a global, boolean variable read once at server startup; it cannot be changed at runtime, so set it via `config.yaml` or as a persisted system variable before starting the server.

### `dolt_optimize_json`

This setting was used during the introduction of a new JSON encoding method and is now deprecated. JSON columns always use the modern, optimized encoding. It may still be relevant to customers on older releases of the database, where setting it to `0` stored JSON as opaque documents instead of the optimized, diffable format. Defaults to `1`.

## Replication variables

### `dolt_replicate_to_remote`

This system variable should be set on replication primaries to name a remote to replicate to. See
[Replication](/sql-reference/server/replication).

```sql
mysql> select name from dolt_remotes;
+---------+
| name    |
+---------+
| remote1 |
| origin  |
+---------+
mysql> SET @@GLOBAL.dolt_replicate_to_remote = remote1;
mysql> CALL dolt_commit('-am', 'push on write');
```

### `dolt_async_replication`

This system variable can be set to `1` on replication primaries to make remote pushes
asynchronous. This setting can cause commits to complete faster since the push to remote is not
synchronous, but it may also increase the remote replication delay. See
[Replication](/sql-reference/server/replication).

```sql
mysql> SET @@GLOBAL.dolt_replicate_to_remote = remote1;
mysql> SET @@GLOBAL.dolt_async_replication = 1;
```

### `dolt_read_replica_remote`

This system variable is set on read replicas to name a remote to pull from. New data is pulled every
time a transaction begins.

Setting either `dolt_replicate_heads` or `dolt_replicate_all_heads` is
also required for read replicas. See [Replication](/sql-reference/server/replication).

```sql
mysql> SET @@GLOBAL.dolt_read_replica_remote = origin;
mysql> SET @@GLOBAL.dolt_replicate_heads = main;
mysql> START TRANSACTION;
```

### `dolt_replicate_all_heads`

This system variable indicates to pull all branches on a read replica at transaction start. Pair
with `dolt_read_replica_remote`. Use is mutually exclusive with `dolt_replicate_heads`. See
[Replication](/sql-reference/server/replication).

```sql
mysql> SET @@GLOBAL.dolt_replicate_all_heads = 1;
```

### `dolt_replicate_heads`

This system variable specifies which branch heads a read replica will fetch.
The wildcard `*` may be used to match zero or more characters in a branch name
and is useful for selecting multiple branch names.
Pair with `dolt_read_replica_remote`. Use is mutually exclusive with
`dolt_replicate_all_heads`. See [Replication](/sql-reference/server/replication).

```sql
mysql> SET @@GLOBAL.dolt_replicate_heads = main;
mysql> SET @@GLOBAL.dolt_replicate_heads = "main,feature1,feature2";
mysql> SET @@GLOBAL.dolt_replicate_heads = "main,release*";
```

### `dolt_replication_remote_url_template`

This system variable indicates that newly created databases should have a remote created according
to the URL template supplied. This URL template must include the `{database}` placeholder. Some
examples:

```sql
set @@persist.dolt_replication_remote_url_template = 'file:///share/doltRemotes/{database}'; -- file based remote
set @@persist.dolt_replication_remote_url_template = 'aws://dynamo-table:s3-bucket/{database}'; -- AWS remote
set @@persist.dolt_replication_remote_url_template = 'gs://mybucket/remotes/{database}'; -- GCP remote
```

On a read replica, setting this variable will cause the server to attempt to clone any unknown
database used in a query or connection string by constructing a remote URL and cloning from that
remote. See [Replication](/sql-reference/server/replication).

### `dolt_read_replica_force_pull`

Set this variable to `1` to cause read replicas to always pull their local copies of remote heads even
when they have diverged from the local copy, which can occur in the case of a `dolt push -f`. A
setting of `0` causes read replicas to reject remote head updates that cannot be fast-forward merged
into the local copy. Defaults to `1`.

### `dolt_skip_replication_errors`

Set this variable to `1` to ignore replication errors on a read replica. Replication errors will log
a warning rather than causing queries to fail. Defaults to `0`.

```sql
mysql> SET @@GLOBAL.dolt_skip_replication_errors = 1;
```

### `dolt_cluster_role`

The role this server plays in a [cluster replication](/sql-reference/server/replication#replication-role-and-epoch) deployment: `primary` (accepts writes and replicates them to standbys) or `standby` (receives replicated writes). This variable only exists when the server is started with cluster replication configured. It is a persisted, string-valued variable that you should not change directly with `SET` — use the `dolt_assume_cluster_role()` procedure, which updates the role and its epoch together. See [Replication Role and Epoch](/sql-reference/server/replication#replication-role-and-epoch).

### `dolt_cluster_role_epoch`

A monotonically increasing integer that tracks cluster role transitions; it is used to arbitrate which server is the current primary when roles change. Like [`dolt_cluster_role`](#dolt_cluster_role), it only exists when cluster replication is configured, is persisted, and is not meant to be set directly with `SET`. See [Replication Role and Epoch](/sql-reference/server/replication#replication-role-and-epoch).

### `dolt_cluster_ack_writes_timeout_secs`

How long, in seconds, a `primary` waits for a `standby` to acknowledge a replicated write before returning to the client. Accepts an integer from `0` to `60`; the default of `0` means the primary does not block waiting for standby acknowledgement. Persisted and settable at runtime.

## Session metadata variables

### `dbname_head_ref`

Each session defines a system variable that controls the current
session head. For a database called `mydb`, this variable
will be called `@@mydb_head_ref` and be set to the current head.

```sql
mydb> select @@mydb_head_ref;
+-------------------------+
| @@SESSION.mydb_head_ref |
+-------------------------+
| refs/heads/master       |
+-------------------------+
```

You can set this session variable to switch your current head. Use either `refs/heads/branchName` or
just `branchName`:

```sql
SET @@mydb_head_ref = 'feature-branch'
```

This is equivalent to:

```sql
call dolt_checkout('feature-branch')
```

### `dbname_head`

This system variable reflects the current HEAD commit's hash. For a database called `mydb`, this
variable will be called `@@mydb_head`. It is read-only.

### `dbname_working`

This system variable reflects the current working root value's hash. For a database called `mydb`,
this variable will be called `@@mydb_working`. Its value corresponds to the current working
hash. Selecting it is useful for diagnostics. It is read-only.

### `dbname_staged`

This system variable reflects the current staged root value's hash. For a database called `mydb`,
this variable will be called `@@mydb_staged` Selecting it is useful for diagnostics. It is
read-only.

## Commit identity variables

These session variables override the author and committer identity for new commits in the current
session. When you open a SQL connection, Dolt reads the matching `DOLT_AUTHOR_*` and
`DOLT_COMMITTER_*` environment variables and uses them as the initial values. Unset variables
fall back to `user.name` and `user.email` from `dolt config`. When no committer identity is set,
an explicit `--author` argument also sets the committer, matching older Dolt versions where
author and committer were a single identity.

### `dolt_author_name`

Overrides the author name on new commits.

### `dolt_author_email`

Overrides the author email on new commits.

### `dolt_author_date`

Overrides the author date on new commits. Accepts an RFC 3339-style subset:
`2006-01-02`, `2006-01-02T15:04:05`, or `2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00` (e.g. `2026-01-15T12:00:00Z`).

### `dolt_committer_name`

Overrides the committer name on new commits.

### `dolt_committer_email`

Overrides the committer email on new commits.

### `dolt_committer_date`

Overrides the committer date on new commits. This is also the way to control the timestamp on a merge commit produced by [`DOLT_MERGE()`](/sql-reference/version-control/dolt-sql-procedures#dolt_merge), which does not accept a `--date` argument:

```sql
SET @@dolt_committer_date = '2023-01-15T10:00:00';
CALL DOLT_MERGE('feature-branch', '--no-ff', '-m', 'my merge commit');
```

#### Examples

Set the committer identity from the shell before running a CLI commit:

```bash
DOLT_COMMITTER_NAME="CI Bot" DOLT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="ci@example.com" dolt commit -m "release tag"
```

Or set the same variables in a SQL session before calling a commit procedure:

```sql
SET @@dolt_committer_name = 'CI Bot';
SET @@dolt_committer_email = 'ci@example.com';
CALL DOLT_COMMIT('-m', 'release tag');
```

## Persisting System Variables

Dolt supports a limited form of system variable persistence. The same way session variables can be
changed with `SET`, global variables can be persisted to disk with `SET PERSIST`. Persisted system
variables survive restarts, loading back into the global variables namespace on startup.

Dolt supports `SET PERSIST` and `SET PERSIST_ONLY` by writing system
variables to the local `.dolt/config.json`. The same result can be
achieved with the CLI by appending `sqlserver.global.` prefix to
keys with the `dolt config add --local` command. System
variables are used as session variables, and the SQL interface is
the encouraged access point. Variables that affect server startup, like
replication, must be set before instantiation.

## Examples

### `SET PERSIST`

```sql
SET PERSIST max_connections = 1000;
SET @@PERSIST.max_connections = 1000;
```

### `SET PERSIST_ONLY`

```sql
SET PERSIST_ONLY back_log = 1000;
SET @@PERSIST_ONLY.back_log = 1000;
```

### CLI

```bash
$ dolt sql -q "set @@persist.max_connections = 1000"
```

### Limitations

Deleting variables with `RESET PERSIST` is not supported.
