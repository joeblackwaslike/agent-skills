NAME
     bash - GNU Bourne-Again SHell

SYNOPSIS
     bash [options] [command_string | file]

COPYRIGHT

DESCRIPTION
     Bash  is  a  command language interpreter that executes commands read from
     the standard input, from a string, or from a file.  It is a  reimplementa-
     tion  and  extension of the Bourne shell, the historical Unix command lan-
     guage interpreter.  Bash also incorporates useful features from  the  Korn
     and C shells (ksh and csh).

     POSIX is the name for a family of computing standards based on Unix.  Bash
     is  intended  to be a conformant implementation of the Shell and Utilities
     portion of the IEEE POSIX  specification  (IEEE  Standard  1003.1).   Bash
     POSIX  mode  (hereafter referred to as posix mode) changes the shell's be-
     havior where its default operation differs from the standard  to  strictly
     conform to the standard.  See SEE ALSO below for a reference to a document
     that  details how posix mode affects bash's behavior.  Bash can be config-
     ured to be POSIX-conformant by default.

OPTIONS
     All of the single-character shell options documented in the description of
     the set builtin command, including -o, can be used  as  options  when  the
     shell is invoked.  In addition, bash interprets the following options when
     it is invoked:

     -c        If  the  -c  option  is present, then commands are read from the
               first non-option argument command_string.  If  there  are  argu-
               ments  after  the command_string, the first argument is assigned
               to $0 and any remaining arguments are assigned to the positional
               parameters.  The assignment to $0 sets the name  of  the  shell,
               which is used in warning and error messages.

     -i        If the -i option is present, the shell is interactive.

     -l        Make  bash  act  as if it had been invoked as a login shell (see
               INVOCATION below).

     -r        If the -r option is present, the shell becomes  restricted  (see
               RESTRICTED SHELL below).

     -s        If the -s option is present, or if no arguments remain after op-
               tion  processing, the shell reads commands from the standard in-
               put.  This option allows the positional  parameters  to  be  set
               when invoking an interactive shell or when reading input through
               a pipe.

     -D        Print  a  list of all double-quoted strings preceded by $ on the
               standard output.  These are the strings that are subject to lan-
               guage translation when the current locale is  not  C  or  POSIX.
               This implies the -n option; no commands will be executed.

     [-+]O [shopt_option]
               shopt_option  is  one of the shell options accepted by the shopt
               builtin (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  If shopt_option  is
               present,  -O  sets  the  value of that option; +O unsets it.  If
               shopt_option is not supplied, bash prints the names  and  values
               of  the  shell options accepted by shopt on the standard output.
               If the invocation option is +O, the output  is  displayed  in  a
               format that may be reused as input.

     --        A -- signals the end of options and disables further option pro-
               cessing.   Any  arguments  after  the  -- are treated as a shell
               script filename (see below) and arguments passed to that script.
               An argument of - is equivalent to --.

     Bash also interprets a number of multi-character options.   These  options
     must  appear on the command line before the single-character options to be
     recognized.

     --debugger
            Arrange for the debugger profile to be executed  before  the  shell
            starts.   Turns  on extended debugging mode (see the description of
            the extdebug option to the shopt builtin below).

     --dump-po-strings
            Equivalent to -D, but  the  output  is  in  the  GNU  gettext  "po"
            (portable object) file format.

     --dump-strings
            Equivalent to -D.

     --help
            Display a usage message on standard output and exit successfully.

     --init-file file
     --rcfile file
            Execute  commands  from  file instead of the standard personal ini-
            tialization file ~/.bashrc if the shell is interactive (see INVOCA-
            TION below).

     --login
            Equivalent to -l.

     --noediting
            Do not use the GNU readline library to read command lines when  the
            shell is interactive.

     --noprofile
            Do not read either the system-wide startup file /etc/profile or any
            of    the    personal    initialization    files   ~/.bash_profile,
            ~/.bash_login, or ~/.profile.  By default, bash reads  these  files
            when it is invoked as a login shell (see INVOCATION below).

     --norc
            Do  not read and execute the personal initialization file ~/.bashrc
            if the shell is interactive.  This option is on by default  if  the
            shell is invoked as sh.

     --posix
            Enable  posix  mode;  change the behavior of bash where the default
            operation differs from the POSIX standard to match the standard.

     --restricted
            The shell becomes restricted (see RESTRICTED SHELL below).

     --verbose
            Equivalent to -v.

     --version
            Show version information for this instance of bash on the  standard
            output and exit successfully.

ARGUMENTS
     If arguments remain after option processing, and neither the -c nor the -s
     option  has  been supplied, the first argument is treated as the name of a
     file containing shell commands (a shell script).  When bash is invoked  in
     this  fashion, $0 is set to the name of the file, and the positional para-
     meters are set to the remaining arguments.  Bash reads and  executes  com-
     mands  from  this file, then exits.  Bash's exit status is the exit status
     of the last command executed in the script.  If no commands are  executed,
     the exit status is 0.  Bash first attempts to open the file in the current
     directory,  and, if no file is found, searches the directories in PATH for
     the script.

INVOCATION
     A login shell is one whose first character of argument zero is a -, or one
     started with the --login option.

     An interactive shell is one started without non-option  arguments  (unless
     -s  is  specified) and without the -c option, and whose standard input and
     standard  error  are  both  connected  to  terminals  (as  determined   by
     isatty(3)),  or  one started with the -i option.  Bash sets PS1 and $- in-
     cludes i if the shell is interactive, so a shell script or a startup  file
     can test this state.

     The following paragraphs describe how bash executes its startup files.  If
     any  of the files exist but cannot be read, bash reports an error.  Tildes
     are expanded in filenames as described below under Tilde Expansion in  the
     EXPANSION section.

     When  bash  is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interac-
     tive shell with the --login option, it first reads and  executes  commands
     from the file /etc/profile, if that file exists.  After reading that file,
     it  looks  for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile, in that or-
     der, and reads and executes commands from the first one that exists and is
     readable.  The --noprofile option may be used when the shell is started to
     inhibit this behavior.

     When an interactive login shell exits, or a  non-interactive  login  shell
     executes  the  exit builtin command, bash reads and executes commands from
     the file ~/.bash_logout, if it exists.

     When an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started, bash reads
     and executes commands from ~/.bashrc, if that file exists.  The --norc op-
     tion inhibits this behavior.  The --rcfile file option causes bash to  use
     file instead of ~/.bashrc.

     When  bash  is started non-interactively, to run a shell script, for exam-
     ple, it looks for the variable BASH_ENV in the  environment,  expands  its
     value  if  it  appears there, and uses the expanded value as the name of a
     file to read and execute.  Bash behaves as if the following  command  were
     executed:

            if [ -n "$BASH_ENV" ]; then . "$BASH_ENV"; fi

     but  does  not  use the value of the PATH variable to search for the file-
     name.

     If bash is invoked with the name sh, it tries to mimic the startup  behav-
     ior  of historical versions of sh as closely as possible, while conforming
     to the POSIX standard as well.   When  invoked  as  an  interactive  login
     shell,  or  a  non-interactive shell with the --login option, it first at-
     tempts to read and execute commands from /etc/profile and  ~/.profile,  in
     that  order.  The --noprofile option inhibits this behavior.  When invoked
     as an interactive shell with the name sh, bash looks for the variable ENV,
     expands its value if it is defined, and uses the  expanded  value  as  the
     name  of a file to read and execute.  Since a shell invoked as sh does not
     attempt to read and execute commands from any  other  startup  files,  the
     --rcfile  option  has no effect.  A non-interactive shell invoked with the
     name sh does not attempt to read any other startup files.

     When invoked as sh, bash enters  posix  mode  after  reading  the  startup
     files.

     When  bash  is started in posix mode, as with the --posix command line op-
     tion, it follows the POSIX standard for startup files.  In this mode,  in-
     teractive  shells  expand  the  ENV variable and read and execute commands
     from the file whose name is the expanded value.  No  other  startup  files
     are read.

     Bash  attempts  to  determine when it is being run with its standard input
     connected to a network connection, as when executed by the historical  and
     rarely-seen  remote shell daemon, usually rshd, or the secure shell daemon
     sshd.  If bash determines it is being run non-interactively in this  fash-
     ion,  it  reads  and executes commands from ~/.bashrc, if that file exists
     and is readable.  Bash does not read this file  if  invoked  as  sh.   The
     --norc  option  inhibits this behavior, and the --rcfile option makes bash
     use a different file instead of ~/.bashrc, but neither rshd nor sshd  gen-
     erally invoke the shell with those options or allow them to be specified.

     If  the  shell  is started with the effective user (group) id not equal to
     the real user (group) id, and the -p option is not  supplied,  no  startup
     files  are  read,  shell functions are not inherited from the environment,
     the SHELLOPTS, BASHOPTS, CDPATH, and GLOBIGNORE variables, if they  appear
     in  the  environment, are ignored, and the effective user id is set to the
     real user id.  If the -p option is supplied at invocation, the startup be-
     havior is the same, but the effective user id is not reset.

DEFINITIONS
     The following definitions are used throughout the rest of this document.
     blank  A space or tab.
     whitespace
            A character belonging to the space character class in  the  current
            locale, or for which isspace(3) returns true.
     word   A  sequence of characters considered as a single unit by the shell.
            Also known as a token.
     name   A word consisting only of alphanumeric characters and  underscores,
            and  beginning with an alphabetic character or an underscore.  Also
            referred to as an identifier.
     metacharacter
            A character that, when unquoted, separates words.  One of the  fol-
            lowing:
            |  & ; ( ) < > space tab newline
     control operator
            A token that performs a control function.  It is one of the follow-
            ing symbols:
            || & && ; ;; ;& ;;& ( ) | |& <newline>

RESERVED WORDS
     Reserved  words  are  words that have a special meaning to the shell.  The
     following words are recognized as reserved when unquoted  and  either  the
     first  word  of  a  command (see SHELL GRAMMAR below), the third word of a
     case or select command (only in is valid), or the third word of a for com-
     mand (only in and do are valid):

     ! case  coproc  do done elif else esac fi for function if in  select  then
     until while { } time [[ ]]

SHELL GRAMMAR
     This section describes the syntax of the various forms of shell commands.

   Simple Commands
     A  simple  command is a sequence of optional variable assignments followed
     by blank-separated words and redirections, and terminated by a control op-
     erator.  The first word specifies the  command  to  be  executed,  and  is
     passed  as  argument zero.  The remaining words are passed as arguments to
     the invoked command.

     The return value of a simple command is its exit status, or 128+n  if  the
     command is terminated by signal n.

   Pipelines
     A  pipeline  is a sequence of one or more commands separated by one of the
     control operators | or |&.  The format for a pipeline is:

            [time [-p]] [ ! ] command1 [ [|||&] command2 ... ]

     The standard output of command1 is connected via a pipe  to  the  standard
     input  of  command2.  This connection is performed before any redirections
     specified by the command1(see REDIRECTION below).  If |& is  the  pipeline
     operator,  command1's  standard error, in addition to its standard output,
     is connected to command2's standard input through the pipe; it  is  short-
     hand  for  2>&1 |.  This implicit redirection of the standard error to the
     standard output is performed after any redirections specified by command1.

     The return status of a pipeline is the exit status of  the  last  command,
     unless  the  pipefail  option  is  enabled.   If  pipefail is enabled, the
     pipeline's return status is the value of the last (rightmost)  command  to
     exit  with  a  non-zero status, or zero if all commands exit successfully.
     If the reserved word !  precedes a  pipeline,  the  exit  status  of  that
     pipeline  is  the  logical negation of the exit status as described above.
     If a pipeline is executed synchronously, the shell waits for all  commands
     in the pipeline to terminate before returning a value.

     If  the  time  reserved  word  precedes  a pipeline, the shell reports the
     elapsed as well as user and system time consumed by its execution when the
     pipeline terminates.  The -p option changes  the  output  format  to  that
     specified  by  POSIX.  When the shell is in posix mode, it does not recog-
     nize time as a reserved word if the next token begins  with  a  "-".   The
     value of the TIMEFORMAT variable is a format string that specifies how the
     timing  information should be displayed; see the description of TIMEFORMAT
     below under Shell Variables.

     When the shell is in posix mode, time may appear by  itself  as  the  only
     word in a simple command.  In this case, the shell displays the total user
     and  system  time  consumed by the shell and its children.  The TIMEFORMAT
     variable specifies the format of the time information.

     Each command in a multi-command pipeline, where pipes are created, is exe-
     cuted in a subshell, which is a separate process.  See  COMMAND  EXECUTION
     ENVIRONMENT for a description of subshells and a subshell environment.  If
     the  lastpipe  option is enabled using the shopt builtin (see the descrip-
     tion of shopt below), and job control is not active, the last element of a
     pipeline may be run by the shell process.

   Lists
     A list is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by one of the  op-
     erators  ;,  &,  &&,  or  ||, and optionally terminated by one of ;, &, or
     <newline>.

     Of these list operators, && and || have equal precedence,  followed  by  ;
     and &, which have equal precedence.

     A sequence of one or more newlines may appear in a list instead of a semi-
     colon to delimit commands.

     If  a  command is terminated by the control operator &, the shell executes
     the command in the background in a subshell.  The shell does not wait  for
     the  command to finish, and the return status is 0.  These are referred to
     as asynchronous commands.  Commands separated by a ; are executed  sequen-
     tially; the shell waits for each command to terminate in turn.  The return
     status is the exit status of the last command executed.

     AND  and  OR lists are sequences of one or more pipelines separated by the
     && and || control operators, respectively.  AND and OR lists are  executed
     with left associativity.  An AND list has the form

            command1 && command2

     command2  is  executed if, and only if, command1 returns an exit status of
     zero (success).

     An OR list has the form

            command1 || command2

     command2 is executed if, and only if, command1  returns  a  non-zero  exit
     status.   The  return status of AND and OR lists is the exit status of the
     last command executed in the list.

   Compound Commands
     A compound command is one of the following.  In most cases  a  list  in  a
     command's description may be separated from the rest of the command by one
     or  more  newlines,  and  may be followed by a newline in place of a semi-
     colon.

     (list)
            list is executed in a subshell (see COMMAND  EXECUTION  ENVIRONMENT
            below  for  a description of a subshell environment).  Variable as-
            signments and builtin commands that affect the shell's  environment
            do  not  remain  in effect after the command completes.  The return
            status is the exit status of list.

     { list; }
            list is executed in the current shell environment.   list  must  be
            terminated  with  a newline or semicolon.  This is known as a group
            command.  The return status is the exit status of list.

            Note that unlike the metacharacters ( and ), { and }  are  reserved
            words  and must occur where a reserved word is permitted to be rec-
            ognized.  Since they do not cause a word break, they must be  sepa-
            rated from list by whitespace or another shell metacharacter.

     ((expression))
            The  arithmetic  expression is evaluated according to the rules de-
            scribed below under ARITHMETIC EVALUATION.  If the value of the ex-
            pression is non-zero, the return status is 0; otherwise the  return
            status is 1.  The expression undergoes the same expansions as if it
            were within double quotes, but unescaped double quote characters in
            expression  are  not treated specially and are removed.  Since this
            can potentially result in empty strings, this command treats  those
            as expressions that evaluate to 0.

     [[ expression ]]
            Evaluate  the conditional expression expression and return a status
            of zero (true) or non-zero (false).  Expressions  are  composed  of
            the  primaries  described below under CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS.  The
            words between the [[ and ]] do not undergo word splitting and path-
            name expansion.  The shell performs tilde expansion, parameter  and
            variable  expansion,  arithmetic  expansion,  command substitution,
            process substitution, and quote removal  on  those  words.   Condi-
            tional  operators  such  as -f must be unquoted to be recognized as
            primaries.

            When used with [[, the < and > operators sort lexicographically us-
            ing the current locale.

            When the == and != operators are used, the string to the  right  of
            the  operator  is considered a pattern and matched according to the
            rules described below under Pattern Matching,  as  if  the  extglob
            shell option were enabled.  The = operator is equivalent to ==.  If
            the  nocasematch  shell  option  is enabled, the match is performed
            without regard to the case of alphabetic  characters.   The  return
            value  is  0  if the string matches (==) or does not match (!=) the
            pattern, and 1 otherwise.  If any part of the  pattern  is  quoted,
            the  quoted  portion is matched as a string: every character in the
            quoted portion matches itself, instead of having any  special  pat-
            tern matching meaning.

            An  additional  binary  operator,  =~,  is available, with the same
            precedence as == and !=.  When it is used, the string to the  right
            of  the  operator is considered a POSIX extended regular expression
            and matched accordingly (using the POSIX regcomp and regexec inter-
            faces usually described in regex(3)).  The return value is 0 if the
            string matches the pattern, and 1 otherwise.  If  the  regular  ex-
            pression  is  syntactically incorrect, the conditional expression's
            return value is 2.  If the nocasematch shell option is enabled, the
            match is performed without regard to the case of alphabetic charac-
            ters.

            If any part of the pattern is quoted, the quoted portion is matched
            literally, as above.  If the pattern is stored in a shell variable,
            quoting the variable expansion forces  the  entire  pattern  to  be
            matched  literally.   Treat  bracket expressions in regular expres-
            sions carefully, since normal quoting and pattern  characters  lose
            their meanings between brackets.

            The  match  succeeds if the pattern matches any part of the string.
            Anchor the pattern using the ^ and $ regular  expression  operators
            to force it to match the entire string.

            The  array  variable BASH_REMATCH records which parts of the string
            matched the pattern.  The element of BASH_REMATCH with index 0 con-
            tains the portion of the string matching the entire regular expres-
            sion.  Substrings matched by  parenthesized  subexpressions  within
            the  regular expression are saved in the remaining BASH_REMATCH in-
            dices.  The element of BASH_REMATCH with index n is the portion  of
            the string matching the nth parenthesized subexpression.  Bash sets
            BASH_REMATCH  in the global scope; declaring it as a local variable
            will lead to unexpected results.

            Expressions may be combined using the following  operators,  listed
            in decreasing order of precedence:

            ( expression )
                   Returns  the value of expression.  This may be used to over-
                   ride the normal precedence of operators.
            ! expression
                   True if expression is false.
            expression1 && expression2
                   True if both expression1 and expression2 are true.
            expression1 || expression2
                   True if either expression1 or expression2 is true.

            The && and || operators do not evaluate expression2 if the value of
            expression1 is sufficient to determine the return value of the  en-
            tire conditional expression.

     for name [ [ in word ... ] ; ] do list ; done
            First,  expand The list of words following in, generating a list of
            items.  Then, the variable name is set to each element of this list
            in turn, and list is executed each time.  If the in word  is  omit-
            ted, the for command executes list once for each positional parame-
            ter  that  is set (see PARAMETERS below).  The return status is the
            exit status of the last command that executes.  If the expansion of
            the items following in results in an empty list,  no  commands  are
            executed, and the return status is 0.

     for (( expr1 ; expr2 ; expr3 )) [;] do list ; done
            First,  evaluate  the  arithmetic expression expr1 according to the
            rules described below under ARITHMETIC EVALUATION.   Then,  repeat-
            edly evaluate the arithmetic expression expr2 until it evaluates to
            zero.   Each time expr2 evaluates to a non-zero value, execute list
            and evaluate the arithmetic expression expr3.  If any expression is
            omitted, it behaves as if it evaluates to 1.  The return  value  is
            the  exit  status  of the last command in list that is executed, or
            non-zero if any of the expressions is invalid.

            Use the break and continue builtins (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS be-
            low) to control loop execution.

     select name [ in word ] ; do list ; done
            First, expand the list of words following in, generating a list  of
            items, and print the set of expanded words the standard error, each
            preceded  by  a number.  If the in word is omitted, print the posi-
            tional parameters (see PARAMETERS below).  select then displays the
            PS3 prompt and reads a line from the standard input.  If  the  line
            consists  of  a number corresponding to one of the displayed words,
            then select sets the value of name to that word.  If  the  line  is
            empty, select displays the words and prompt again.  If EOF is read,
            select completes and returns 1.  Any other value sets name to null.
            The line read is saved in the variable REPLY.  The list is executed
            after  each  selection until a break command is executed.  The exit
            status of select is the exit status of the last command executed in
            list, or zero if no commands were executed.

     case word in [ [(] pattern [ | pattern ] ... ) list ;; ] ... esac
            A case command first expands word, and tries to  match  it  against
            each  pattern  in  turn,  proceeding  from first to last, using the
            matching rules described under Pattern Matching below.   A  pattern
            list  is a set of one or more patterns separated by , and the ) op-
            erator terminates the pattern list.  The  word  is  expanded  using
            tilde  expansion,  parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic ex-
            pansion, command substitution, process substitution and  quote  re-
            moval.   Each  pattern  examined is expanded using tilde expansion,
            parameter and variable  expansion,  arithmetic  expansion,  command
            substitution,  process substitution, and quote removal.  If the no-
            casematch shell option is enabled, the match is  performed  without
            regard to the case of alphabetic characters.  A clause is a pattern
            list and an associated list.

            When  a  match  is found, case executes the corresponding list.  If
            the ;; operator terminates the case clause, the case  command  com-
            pletes  after the first match.  Using ;& in place of ;; causes exe-
            cution to continue with the list associated with the  next  pattern
            list.   Using  ;;& in place of ;; causes the shell to test the next
            pattern list in the statement, if any, and execute  any  associated
            list if the match succeeds, continuing the case statement execution
            as if the pattern list had not matched.  The exit status is zero if
            no pattern matches.

            Otherwise,  it  is  the exit status of the last command executed in
            the last list executed.

     if list; then list; [ elif list; then list; ] ... [ else list; ] fi
            The if list is executed.  If its exit status is zero, the then list
            is executed.  Otherwise, each elif list is executed in turn, and if
            its exit status is zero, the corresponding then  list  is  executed
            and  the  command completes.  Otherwise, the else list is executed,
            if present.  The exit status is the exit status of the last command
            executed, or zero if no condition tested true.

     while list-1; do list-2; done
     until list-1; do list-2; done
            The while command continuously executes the list list-2 as long  as
            the last command in the list list-1 returns an exit status of zero.
            The  until  command  is identical to the while command, except that
            the test is negated: list-2 is executed as long as the last command
            in list-1 returns a non-zero exit status.  The exit status  of  the
            while and until commands is the exit status of the last command ex-
            ecuted in list-2, or zero if none was executed.

   Coprocesses
     A  coprocess  is  a shell command preceded by the coproc reserved word.  A
     coprocess is executed asynchronously in a subshell, as if the command  had
     been  terminated  with  the & control operator, with a two-way pipe estab-
     lished between the executing shell and the coprocess.

     The syntax for a coprocess is:

            coproc [NAME] command [redirections]

     This creates a coprocess named NAME.  command may be either a simple  com-
     mand  or  a  compound command (see above).  NAME is a shell variable name.
     If NAME is not supplied, the default name is COPROC.

     The recommended form to use for a coprocess is

            coproc NAME { command [redirections]; }

     This form is preferred because simple commands result in the coprocess al-
     ways being named COPROC, and it is simpler to use and more  complete  than
     the other compound commands.

     If command is a compound command, NAME is optional. The word following co-
     proc determines whether that word is interpreted as a variable name: it is
     interpreted  as  NAME  if it is not a reserved word that introduces a com-
     pound command.  If command is a simple command, NAME is not allowed;  this
     is  to  avoid confusion between NAME and the first word of the simple com-
     mand.

     When the coprocess is executed, the shell creates an array  variable  (see
     Arrays below) named NAME in the context of the executing shell.  The stan-
     dard output of command is connected via a pipe to a file descriptor in the
     executing  shell,  and  that  file descriptor is assigned to NAME[0].  The
     standard input of command is connected via a pipe to a file descriptor  in
     the  executing  shell,  and  that  file descriptor is assigned to NAME[1].
     This pipe is established before any redirections specified by the  command
     (see  REDIRECTION  below).   The file descriptors can be utilized as argu-
     ments to shell commands and redirections using standard  word  expansions.
     Other than those created to execute command and process substitutions, the
     file descriptors are not available in subshells.

     The  process ID of the shell spawned to execute the coprocess is available
     as the value of the variable NAME_PID.  The wait builtin may  be  used  to
     wait for the coprocess to terminate.

     Since the coprocess is created as an asynchronous command, the coproc com-
     mand always returns success.  The return status of a coprocess is the exit
     status of command.

   Shell Function Definitions
     A shell function is an object that is called like a simple command and ex-
     ecutes  a compound command with a new set of positional parameters.  Shell
     functions are declared as follows:

     fname () compound-command [redirection]
     function fname [()] compound-command [redirection]
            This defines a function named fname.  The reserved word function is
            optional.  If the function reserved word is supplied, the parenthe-
            ses are optional.  The body of the function is the compound command
            compound-command (see Compound Commands above).   That  command  is
            usually  a list of commands between { and }, but may be any command
            listed under Compound Commands above.   If  the  function  reserved
            word  is used, but the parentheses are not supplied, the braces are
            recommended.  compound-command is executed whenever fname is speci-
            fied as the name of a simple command.  When in  posix  mode,  fname
            must  be  a  valid shell name and may not be the name of one of the
            POSIX special builtins.  In default mode, a function  name  can  be
            any unquoted shell word that does not contain $.

     Any  redirections (see REDIRECTION below) specified when a function is de-
     fined are performed when the function is executed.

     The exit status of a function definition is zero unless a syntax error oc-
     curs or a readonly function with the same name already exists.  When  exe-
     cuted,  the  exit status of a function is the exit status of the last com-
     mand executed in the body.  (See FUNCTIONS below.)

COMMENTS
     In a non-interactive shell, or an interactive shell in which the  interac-
     tive_comments  option  to  the shopt builtin is enabled (see SHELL BUILTIN
     COMMANDS below), a word beginning with # introduces a comment.  A word be-
     gins at the beginning of a line, after unquoted whitespace,  or  after  an
     operator.   The  comment  causes that word and all remaining characters on
     that line to be  ignored.   An  interactive  shell  without  the  interac-
     tive_comments  option  enabled  does  not  allow  comments.   The interac-
     tive_comments option is enabled by default in interactive shells.

QUOTING
     Quoting is used to remove the special meaning  of  certain  characters  or
     words  to the shell.  Quoting can be used to disable special treatment for
     special characters, to prevent reserved words  from  being  recognized  as
     such, and to prevent parameter expansion.

     Each  of  the  metacharacters  listed  above under DEFINITIONS has special
     meaning to the shell and must be quoted if it is to represent itself.

     When the command history expansion facilities are being used (see  HISTORY
     EXPANSION  below),  the  history  expansion  character, usually !, must be
     quoted to prevent history expansion.

     There are four quoting mechanisms: the escape  character,  single  quotes,
     double quotes, and dollar-single quotes.

     A non-quoted backslash (\) is the escape character.  It preserves the lit-
     eral  value of the next character that follows, removing any special mean-
     ing it has, with the exception of <newline>.  If  a  \<newline>  pair  ap-
     pears,  and  the backslash is not itself quoted, the \<newline> is treated
     as a line continuation (that is, it is removed from the input  stream  and
     effectively ignored).

     Enclosing  characters in single quotes preserves the literal value of each
     character within the quotes.  A single quote may not occur between  single
     quotes, even when preceded by a backslash.

     Enclosing  characters  in double quotes preserves the literal value of all
     characters within the quotes, with the exception of $,  `,  \,  and,  when
     history  expansion  is enabled, !.  When the shell is in posix mode, the !
     has no special meaning within double quotes, even when  history  expansion
     is  enabled.   The  characters $ and ` retain their special meaning within
     double quotes.  The backslash retains its special meaning only  when  fol-
     lowed by one of the following characters: $, `, ", \, or <newline>.  Back-
     slashes  preceding  characters  without a special meaning are left unmodi-
     fied.

     A double quote may be quoted within double quotes by preceding it  with  a
     backslash.   If  enabled,  history expansion will be performed unless an !
     appearing in double quotes is escaped using a  backslash.   The  backslash
     preceding the !  is not removed.

     The  special parameters * and @ have special meaning when in double quotes
     (see PARAMETERS below).

     Character sequences of the form $'string' are treated as a special variant
     of single quotes.  The sequence expands to string, with  backslash-escaped
     characters  in string replaced as specified by the ANSI C standard.  Back-
     slash escape sequences, if present, are decoded as follows:
            \a     alert (bell)
            \b     backspace
            \e
            \E     an escape character
            \f     form feed
            \n     new line
            \r     carriage return
            \t     horizontal tab
            \v     vertical tab
            \\     backslash
            \'     single quote
            \"     double quote
            \?     question mark
            \nnn   The eight-bit character whose value is the octal  value  nnn
                   (one to three octal digits).
            \xHH   The eight-bit character whose value is the hexadecimal value
                   HH (one or two hex digits).
            \uHHHH
                   The  Unicode  (ISO/IEC  10646)  character whose value is the
                   hexadecimal value HHHH (one to four hex digits).
            \UHHHHHHHH
                   The Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) character  whose  value  is  the
                   hexadecimal value HHHHHHHH (one to eight hex digits).
            \cx    A control-x character.

     The  expanded  result is single-quoted, as if the dollar sign had not been
     present.

   Translating Strings
     A double-quoted string preceded by a dollar sign  ($"string")  causes  the
     string  to be translated according to the current locale.  The gettext in-
     frastructure performs the lookup and translation, using  the  LC_MESSAGES,
     TEXTDOMAINDIR, and TEXTDOMAIN shell variables.  If the current locale is C
     or  POSIX, if there are no translations available, or if the string is not
     translated, the dollar sign is ignored, and the string is treated as  dou-
     ble-quoted  as  described above.  This is a form of double quoting, so the
     string remains double-quoted by default, whether or not it  is  translated
     and  replaced.   If  the  noexpand_translation option is enabled using the
     shopt builtin, translated strings are  single-quoted  instead  of  double-
     quoted.  See the description of shopt below under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS.

PARAMETERS
     A  parameter is an entity that stores values.  It can be a name, a number,
     or one of the special characters listed below under Special Parameters.  A
     variable is a parameter denoted by a name.  A variable  has  a  value  and
     zero  or  more  attributes.   Attributes  are  assigned  using the declare
     builtin command (see declare below in SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS).  The export
     and readonly builtins assign specific attributes.

     A parameter is set if it has been assigned a value.  The null string is  a
     valid  value.   Once  a variable is set, it may be unset only by using the
     unset builtin command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).

     A variable is assigned to using a statement of the form

            name=[value]

     If value is not given, the variable is assigned the null string.  All val-
     ues undergo tilde expansion, parameter  and  variable  expansion,  command
     substitution,  arithmetic  expansion, and quote removal (see EXPANSION be-
     low).  If the variable has its integer attribute set, then value is evalu-
     ated as an arithmetic expression even if the  $((...))  expansion  is  not
     used (see Arithmetic Expansion below).  Word splitting and pathname expan-
     sion  are  not  performed.  Assignment statements may also appear as argu-
     ments to the alias, declare, typeset, export, readonly, and local  builtin
     commands  (declaration  commands).  When in posix mode, these builtins may
     appear in a command after one or more instances of the command builtin and
     retain these assignment statement properties.

     In the context where an assignment statement is assigning  a  value  to  a
     shell variable or array index, the "+=" operator appends to or adds to the
     variable's  previous  value.   This includes arguments to declaration com-
     mands such as declare that accept assignment statements.  When "+=" is ap-
     plied to a variable for which the integer  attribute  has  been  set,  the
     variable's  current  value  and value are each evaluated as arithmetic ex-
     pressions, and the sum of the results is assigned as the variable's value.
     The current value is usually an integer constant, but may  be  an  expres-
     sion.  When "+=" is applied to an array variable using compound assignment
     (see Arrays below), the variable's value is not unset (as it is when using
     "="),  and  new  values are appended to the array beginning at one greater
     than the array's maximum index (for indexed arrays) or added as additional
     key-value pairs in an associative array.  When applied to a  string-valued
     variable, value is expanded and appended to the variable's value.

     A  variable  can  be assigned the nameref attribute using the -n option to
     the declare or local builtin commands (see the descriptions of declare and
     local below) to create a nameref, or  a  reference  to  another  variable.
     This  allows variables to be manipulated indirectly.  Whenever the nameref
     variable is referenced, assigned to, unset, or has its attributes modified
     (other than using or changing the nameref attribute itself), the operation
     is actually performed on the variable specified by the nameref  variable's
     value.   A  nameref  is commonly used within shell functions to refer to a
     variable whose name is passed as an argument to  the  function.   For  in-
     stance,  if a variable name is passed to a shell function as its first ar-
     gument, running

            declare -n ref=$1

     inside the function creates a local nameref variable ref  whose  value  is
     the  variable  name  passed as the first argument.  References and assign-
     ments to ref, and changes to its attributes, are  treated  as  references,
     assignments,  and  attribute  modifications to the variable whose name was
     passed as $1.  If the control variable in a for loop has the  nameref  at-
     tribute,  the  list  of words can be a list of shell variables, and a name
     reference is established for each word in the list, in turn, when the loop
     is executed.  Array variables cannot be given the nameref attribute.  How-
     ever, nameref variables can reference array variables and subscripted  ar-
     ray  variables.   Namerefs  can  be unset using the -n option to the unset
     builtin.  Otherwise, if unset is executed with the name of a nameref vari-
     able as an argument, the variable referenced by the  nameref  variable  is
     unset.

     When  the shell starts, it reads its environment and creates a shell vari-
     able from each environment variable that has a valid  name,  as  described
     below (see ENVIRONMENT).

   Positional Parameters
     A positional parameter is a parameter denoted by one or more digits, other
     than  the  single  digit  0.   Positional parameters are assigned from the
     shell's arguments when it is invoked, and may be reassigned using the  set
     builtin  command.   Positional  parameters may not be assigned to with as-
     signment statements.  The positional parameters are  temporarily  replaced
     when a shell function is executed (see FUNCTIONS below).

     When  a positional parameter consisting of more than a single digit is ex-
     panded, it must be enclosed in  braces  (see  EXPANSION  below).   Without
     braces,  a digit following $ can only refer to one of the first nine posi-
     tional parameters ($1-$9) or the special parameter $0 (see the  next  sec-
     tion).

   Special Parameters
     The  shell treats several parameters specially.  These parameters may only
     be referenced; assignment to them is not allowed.  Special parameters  are
     denoted by one of the following characters.

     *      ($*) Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one.  When
            the  expansion is not within double quotes, each positional parame-
            ter expands to a separate word.  In contexts where word  expansions
            are  performed,  those  words are subject to further word splitting
            and pathname expansion.  When the expansion  occurs  within  double
            quotes,  it expands to a single word with the value of each parame-
            ter separated by the first character of the IFS variable.  That is,
            "$*" is equivalent to "$1c$2c...", where c is the  first  character
            of  the value of the IFS variable.  If IFS is unset, the parameters
            are separated by spaces.  If IFS is null, the parameters are joined
            without intervening separators.
     @      ($@) Expands to the positional parameters, starting from  one.   In
            contexts where word splitting is performed, this expands each posi-
            tional  parameter  to a separate word; if not within double quotes,
            these words are subject to word splitting.  In contexts where  word
            splitting is not performed, such as the value portion of an assign-
            ment  statement, this expands to a single word with each positional
            parameter separated by a space.  When the expansion  occurs  within
            double  quotes, and word splitting is performed, each parameter ex-
            pands  to  a  separate  word.   That  is,  "$@"  is  equivalent  to
            "$1" "$2" ...  If the double-quoted expansion occurs within a word,
            the  expansion  of the first parameter is joined with the expansion
            of the beginning part of the original word, and  the  expansion  of
            the last parameter is joined with the expansion of the last part of
            the  original  word.  When there are no positional parameters, "$@"
            and $@ expand to nothing (i.e., they are removed).
     #      ($#) Expands to the number of positional parameters in decimal.
     ?      ($?) Expands to the exit status of the most recently executed  com-
            mand.
     -      ($-)  Expands to the current option flags as specified upon invoca-
            tion, by the set builtin command, or those set by the shell  itself
            (such as the -i option).
     $      ($$) Expands to the process ID of the shell.  In a subshell, it ex-
            pands to the process ID of the parent shell, not the subshell.
     !      ($!)Expands  to the process ID of the job most recently placed into
            the background, whether executed as an asynchronous command or  us-
            ing the bg builtin (see JOB CONTROL below).
     0      ($0) Expands to the name of the shell or shell script.  This is set
            at  shell  initialization.   If bash is invoked with a file of com-
            mands, $0 is set to the name of that file.  If bash is started with
            the -c option, then $0 is set  to  the  first  argument  after  the
            string  to be executed, if one is present.  Otherwise, it is set to
            the filename used to invoke bash, as given by argument zero.

   Shell Variables
     The shell sets following variables:

     _      ($_, an underscore) This has a number of meanings depending on con-
            text.  At shell startup, _ is set to the pathname  used  to  invoke
            the  shell or shell script being executed as passed in the environ-
            ment or argument list.  Subsequently, it expands to the last  argu-
            ment to the previous simple command executed in the foreground, af-
            ter  expansion.  It is also set to the full pathname used to invoke
            each command executed and placed in  the  environment  exported  to
            that  command.   When  checking mail, $_ expands to the name of the
            mail file currently being checked.
     BASH   Expands to the full filename used to invoke this instance of bash.
     BASHOPTS
            A colon-separated list of enabled shell options.  Each word in  the
            list  is  a  valid  argument for the -s option to the shopt builtin
            command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  The options  appearing
            in BASHOPTS are those reported as on by shopt.  If this variable is
            in  the environment when bash starts up, the shell enables each op-
            tion in the list before reading any startup files.  If  this  vari-
            able is exported, child shells will enable each option in the list.
            This variable is read-only.
     BASHPID
            Expands  to  the process ID of the current bash process.  This dif-
            fers from $$ under certain circumstances, such as subshells that do
            not require bash to be re-initialized.  Assignments to BASHPID have
            no effect.  If BASHPID is unset, it loses its  special  properties,
            even if it is subsequently reset.
     BASH_ALIASES
            An  associative  array variable whose members correspond to the in-
            ternal list of aliases as maintained by the  alias  builtin.   Ele-
            ments added to this array appear in the alias list; however, unset-
            ting  array  elements  currently  does  not remove aliases from the
            alias list.  If BASH_ALIASES is unset, it loses its special proper-
            ties, even if it is subsequently reset.
     BASH_ARGC
            An array variable whose values are the number of parameters in each
            frame of the current bash execution call stack.  The number of  pa-
            rameters  to  the current subroutine (shell function or script exe-
            cuted with . or source) is at the top of the stack.  When a subrou-
            tine is executed, the number of parameters passed  is  pushed  onto
            BASH_ARGC.   The  shell sets BASH_ARGC only when in extended debug-
            ging mode (see the description of the extdebug option to the  shopt
            builtin  below).   Setting  extdebug after the shell has started to
            execute a script, or referencing this variable when extdebug is not
            set, may result in inconsistent values.  Assignments  to  BASH_ARGC
            have no effect, and it may not be unset.
     BASH_ARGV
            An  array  variable containing all of the parameters in the current
            bash execution call stack.  The final parameter of the last subrou-
            tine call is at the top of the stack; the first  parameter  of  the
            initial  call is at the bottom.  When a subroutine is executed, the
            shell pushes the supplied parameters  onto  BASH_ARGV.   The  shell
            sets  BASH_ARGV  only  when in extended debugging mode (see the de-
            scription of the extdebug option to the shopt builtin below).  Set-
            ting extdebug after the shell has started to execute a  script,  or
            referencing  this  variable when extdebug is not set, may result in
            inconsistent values.  Assignments to BASH_ARGV have no effect,  and
            it may not be unset.
     BASH_ARGV0
            When  referenced, this variable expands to the name of the shell or
            shell script (identical to $0; see the description of special para-
            meter 0 above).  Assigning a value to BASH_ARGV0  sets  $0  to  the
            same  value.   If BASH_ARGV0 is unset, it loses its special proper-
            ties, even if it is subsequently reset.
     BASH_CMDS
            An associative array variable whose members correspond to  the  in-
            ternal  hash  table  of commands as maintained by the hash builtin.
            Adding elements to this array makes them appear in the hash  table;
            however, unsetting array elements currently does not remove command
            names  from  the  hash  table.  If BASH_CMDS is unset, it loses its
            special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.
     BASH_COMMAND
            Expands to the command currently being executed or about to be exe-
            cuted, unless the shell is executing a command as the result  of  a
            trap,  in which case it is the command executing at the time of the
            trap.  If BASH_COMMAND is unset, it loses its  special  properties,
            even if it is subsequently reset.
     BASH_EXECUTION_STRING
            The command argument to the -c invocation option.
     BASH_LINENO
            An  array  variable  whose  members  are the line numbers in source
            files where each corresponding  member  of  FUNCNAME  was  invoked.
            ${BASH_LINENO[$i]}   is   the   line  number  in  the  source  file
            (${BASH_SOURCE[$i+1]})  where  ${FUNCNAME[$i]}   was   called   (or
            ${BASH_LINENO[$i-1]}  if referenced within another shell function).
            Use LINENO to obtain  the  current  line  number.   Assignments  to
            BASH_LINENO have no effect, and it may not be unset.
     BASH_LOADABLES_PATH
            A  colon-separated  list of directories in which the enable command
            looks for dynamically loadable builtins.
     BASH_MONOSECONDS
            Each time this variable is referenced, it expands to the value  re-
            turned  by  the  system's monotonic clock, if one is available.  If
            there is no monotonic clock, this is  equivalent  to  EPOCHSECONDS.
            If BASH_MONOSECONDS is unset, it loses its special properties, even
            if it is subsequently reset.
     BASH_REMATCH
            An array variable whose members are assigned by the =~ binary oper-
            ator  to  the  [[ conditional command.  The element with index 0 is
            the portion of the string matching the entire  regular  expression.
            The  element with index n is the portion of the string matching the
            nth parenthesized subexpression.
     BASH_SOURCE
            An array variable whose members are the source filenames where  the
            corresponding  shell  function names in the FUNCNAME array variable
            are defined.  The shell function ${FUNCNAME[$i]} is defined in  the
            file  ${BASH_SOURCE[$i]} and called from ${BASH_SOURCE[$i+1]}.  As-
            signments to BASH_SOURCE have no effect, and it may not be unset.
     BASH_SUBSHELL
            Incremented by one within each  subshell  or  subshell  environment
            when  the  shell begins executing in that environment.  The initial
            value is 0.  If BASH_SUBSHELL is unset, it loses its special  prop-
            erties, even if it is subsequently reset.
     BASH_TRAPSIG
            Set to the signal number corresponding to the trap action being ex-
            ecuted  during  its  execution.   See the description of trap under
            SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below for information about  signal  numbers
            and trap execution.
     BASH_VERSINFO
            A  readonly  array  variable whose members hold version information
            for this instance of bash.  The values assigned to the  array  mem-
            bers are as follows:
            BASH_VERSINFO[0]        The major version number (the release).
            BASH_VERSINFO[1]        The minor version number (the version).
            BASH_VERSINFO[2]        The patch level.
            BASH_VERSINFO[3]        The build version.
            BASH_VERSINFO[4]        The release status (e.g., beta).
            BASH_VERSINFO[5]        The value of MACHTYPE.
     BASH_VERSION
            Expands to a string describing the version of this instance of bash
            (e.g., 5.2.37(3)-release).
     COMP_CWORD
            An index into ${COMP_WORDS} of the word containing the current cur-
            sor  position.   This variable is available only in shell functions
            invoked by the programmable completion facilities (see Programmable
            Completion below).
     COMP_KEY
            The key (or final key of a key sequence) used to invoke the current
            completion function.  This variable  is  available  only  in  shell
            functions and external commands invoked by the programmable comple-
            tion facilities (see Programmable Completion below).
     COMP_LINE
            The current command line.  This variable is available only in shell
            functions and external commands invoked by the programmable comple-
            tion facilities (see Programmable Completion below).
     COMP_POINT
            The  index of the current cursor position relative to the beginning
            of the current command.  If the current cursor position is  at  the
            end  of the current command, the value of this variable is equal to
            ${#COMP_LINE}.  This variable is available only in shell  functions
            and external commands invoked by the programmable completion facil-
            ities (see Programmable Completion below).
     COMP_TYPE
            Set to an integer value corresponding to the type of attempted com-
            pletion  that  caused  a completion function to be called: TAB, for
            normal completion, ?,  for  listing  completions  after  successive
            tabs, !, for listing alternatives on partial word completion, @, to
            list completions if the word is not unmodified, or %, for menu com-
            pletion.   This  variable  is available only in shell functions and
            external commands invoked by the programmable completion facilities
            (see Programmable Completion below).
     COMP_WORDBREAKS
            The set of characters that the readline library treats as word sep-
            arators when performing word completion.  If COMP_WORDBREAKS is un-
            set, it loses its special properties, even if  it  is  subsequently
            reset.
     COMP_WORDS
            An  array  variable (see Arrays below) consisting of the individual
            words in the current command line.  The line is split into words as
            readline would split it, using COMP_WORDBREAKS as described  above.
            This  variable  is available only in shell functions invoked by the
            programmable completion facilities (see Programmable Completion be-
            low).
     COPROC
            An array variable (see Arrays below) created to hold the  file  de-
            scriptors  for  output  from and input to an unnamed coprocess (see
            Coprocesses above).
     DIRSTACK
            An array variable (see Arrays below) containing  the  current  con-
            tents  of  the directory stack.  Directories appear in the stack in
            the order they are displayed by the  dirs  builtin.   Assigning  to
            members  of  this  array variable may be used to modify directories
            already in the stack, but the pushd and popd builtins must be  used
            to add and remove directories.  Assigning to this variable does not
            change  the  current directory.  If DIRSTACK is unset, it loses its
            special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.
     EPOCHREALTIME
            Each time this parameter is referenced, it expands to the number of
            seconds since the Unix Epoch  (see  time(3))  as  a  floating-point
            value  with micro-second granularity.  Assignments to EPOCHREALTIME
            are ignored.  If EPOCHREALTIME is unset, it loses its special prop-
            erties, even if it is subsequently reset.
     EPOCHSECONDS
            Each time this parameter is referenced, it expands to the number of
            seconds  since  the  Unix  Epoch  (see  time(3)).   Assignments  to
            EPOCHSECONDS  are  ignored.  If EPOCHSECONDS is unset, it loses its
            special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.
     EUID   Expands to the effective user ID of the current  user,  initialized
            at shell startup.  This variable is readonly.
     FUNCNAME
            An  array variable containing the names of all shell functions cur-
            rently in the execution call stack.  The element with  index  0  is
            the  name  of  any currently-executing shell function.  The bottom-
            most element (the one with the  highest  index)  is  "main".   This
            variable  exists  only when a shell function is executing.  Assign-
            ments to FUNCNAME have no effect.  If FUNCNAME is unset,  it  loses
            its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.

            This  variable  can be used with BASH_LINENO and BASH_SOURCE.  Each
            element of FUNCNAME has corresponding elements in  BASH_LINENO  and
            BASH_SOURCE   to   describe   the   call   stack.    For  instance,
            ${FUNCNAME[$i]} was called from the  file  ${BASH_SOURCE[$i+1]}  at
            line  number  ${BASH_LINENO[$i]}.   The caller builtin displays the
            current call stack using this information.
     GROUPS
            An array variable containing the list of groups of which  the  cur-
            rent  user  is a member.  Assignments to GROUPS have no effect.  If
            GROUPS is unset, it loses its special properties,  even  if  it  is
            subsequently reset.
     HISTCMD
            The  history  number,  or index in the history list, of the current
            command.  Assignments to HISTCMD have no effect.  If HISTCMD is un-
            set, it loses its special properties, even if  it  is  subsequently
            reset.
     HOSTNAME
            Automatically set to the name of the current host.
     HOSTTYPE
            Automatically  set  to a string that uniquely describes the type of
            machine on which bash is executing.  The default  is  system-depen-
            dent.
     LINENO
            Each  time  this  parameter  is referenced, the shell substitutes a
            decimal number representing  the  current  sequential  line  number
            (starting  with  1)  within  a  script  or function.  When not in a
            script or function, the value substituted is not guaranteed  to  be
            meaningful.   If  LINENO is unset, it loses its special properties,
            even if it is subsequently reset.
     MACHTYPE
            Automatically set to a string that fully describes the system  type
            on  which bash is executing, in the standard GNU cpu-company-system
            format.  The default is system-dependent.
     MAPFILE
            An array variable (see Arrays below) created to hold the text  read
            by the mapfile builtin when no variable name is supplied.
     OLDPWD
            The previous working directory as set by the cd command.
     OPTARG
            The  value  of  the  last  option argument processed by the getopts
            builtin command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).
     OPTIND
            The index of the next argument  to  be  processed  by  the  getopts
            builtin command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).
     OSTYPE
            Automatically  set  to a string that describes the operating system
            on which bash is executing.  The default is system-dependent.
     PIPESTATUS
            An array variable (see Arrays below) containing a list of exit sta-
            tus values from the commands in  the  most-recently-executed  fore-
            ground  pipeline,  which  may consist of only a simple command (see
            SHELL GRAMMAR above).  Bash sets PIPESTATUS after executing  multi-
            element  pipelines,  timed  and negated pipelines, simple commands,
            subshells created with the ( operator, the [[ and (( compound  com-
            mands, and after error conditions that result in the shell aborting
            command execution.
     PPID   The process ID of the shell's parent.  This variable is readonly.
     PWD    The current working directory as set by the cd command.
     RANDOM
            Each  time this parameter is referenced, it expands to a random in-
            teger between 0 and 32767.  Assigning a value to RANDOM initializes
            (seeds) the sequence of random numbers.  Seeding the random  number
            generator  with  the same constant value produces the same sequence
            of values.  If RANDOM is unset, it loses  its  special  properties,
            even if it is subsequently reset.
     READLINE_ARGUMENT
            Any  numeric  argument given to a readline command that was defined
            using "bind -x" (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below) when it was  in-
            voked.
     READLINE_LINE
            The  contents  of  the readline line buffer, for use with "bind -x"
            (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).
     READLINE_MARK
            The position of the mark (saved insertion point)  in  the  readline
            line buffer, for use with "bind -x" (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS be-
            low).   The characters between the insertion point and the mark are
            often called the region.
     READLINE_POINT
            The position of the insertion point in the  readline  line  buffer,
            for use with "bind -x" (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).
     REPLY  Set  to  the line of input read by the read builtin command when no
            arguments are supplied.
     SECONDS
            Each time this parameter is referenced, it expands to the number of
            seconds since shell invocation.  If a value is assigned to SECONDS,
            the value returned upon subsequent references is the number of sec-
            onds since the assignment plus the value assigned.  The  number  of
            seconds  at shell invocation and the current time are always deter-
            mined by querying the system clock at  one-second  resolution.   If
            SECONDS  is  unset,  it loses its special properties, even if it is
            subsequently reset.
     SHELLOPTS
            A colon-separated list of enabled shell options.  Each word in  the
            list  is a valid argument for the -o option to the set builtin com-
            mand (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  The options appearing  in
            SHELLOPTS  are those reported as on by set -o.  If this variable is
            in the environment when bash starts up, the shell enables each  op-
            tion  in  the list before reading any startup files.  If this vari-
            able is exported, child shells will enable each option in the list.
            This variable is read-only.
     SHLVL  Incremented by one each time an instance of bash is started.
     SRANDOM
            Each time it is referenced,  this  variable  expands  to  a  32-bit
            pseudo-random number.  The random number generator is not linear on
            systems  that  support  /dev/urandom  or arc4random(3), so each re-
            turned number has no relationship to the numbers preceding it.  The
            random number generator cannot be seeded, so  assignments  to  this
            variable have no effect.  If SRANDOM is unset, it loses its special
            properties, even if it is subsequently reset.
     UID    Expands  to  the  user ID of the current user, initialized at shell
            startup.  This variable is readonly.

     The shell uses the following variables. In some cases, bash assigns a  de-
     fault value to a variable; these cases are noted below.

     BASH_COMPAT
            The  value  is  used  to  set the shell's compatibility level.  See
            SHELL COMPATIBILITY MODE below for a  description  of  the  various
            compatibility levels and their effects.  The value may be a decimal
            number  (e.g.,  4.2)  or an integer (e.g., 42) corresponding to the
            desired compatibility level.  If BASH_COMPAT is unset or set to the
            empty string, the compatibility level is set to the default for the
            current version.  If BASH_COMPAT is set to a value that is not  one
            of  the  valid compatibility levels, the shell prints an error mes-
            sage and sets the compatibility level to the default for  the  cur-
            rent  version.  A subset of the valid values correspond to the com-
            patibility levels described below under SHELL  COMPATIBILITY  MODE.
            For  example,  4.2  and  42 are valid values that correspond to the
            compat42 shopt option and set the compatibility level to  42.   The
            current version is also a valid value.
     BASH_ENV
            If this parameter is set when bash is executing a shell script, its
            expanded  value is interpreted as a filename containing commands to
            initialize the shell before it reads and executes commands from the
            script.  The value of BASH_ENV is subjected to parameter expansion,
            command substitution, and arithmetic expansion before being  inter-
            preted as a filename.  PATH is not used to search for the resultant
            filename.
     BASH_XTRACEFD
            If set to an integer corresponding to a valid file descriptor, bash
            writes  the trace output generated when "set -x" is enabled to that
            file descriptor, instead of the standard error.  The file  descrip-
            tor  is closed when BASH_XTRACEFD is unset or assigned a new value.
            Unsetting BASH_XTRACEFD or assigning it the empty string causes the
            trace output to be sent to the standard error.  Note  that  setting
            BASH_XTRACEFD  to  2  (the standard error file descriptor) and then
            unsetting it will result in the standard error being closed.
     CDPATH
            The search path for the cd command.  This is a colon-separated list
            of directories where the shell looks for directories  specified  as
            arguments to the cd command.  A sample value is ".:~:/usr".
     CHILD_MAX
            Set  the  number of exited child status values for the shell to re-
            member.  Bash will not allow this value to  be  decreased  below  a
            POSIX-mandated  minimum,  and  there  is a maximum value (currently
            8192) that this may not exceed.  The minimum value is system-depen-
            dent.
     COLUMNS
            Used by the select compound command to determine the terminal width
            when printing selection lists.  Automatically set if the  checkwin-
            size option is enabled or in an interactive shell upon receipt of a
            SIGWINCH.
     COMPREPLY
            An  array  variable  from which bash reads the possible completions
            generated by a shell function invoked by the  programmable  comple-
            tion facility (see Programmable Completion below).  Each array ele-
            ment contains one possible completion.
     EMACS  If  bash  finds  this  variable  in  the environment when the shell
            starts with value "t", it assumes that the shell is running  in  an
            Emacs shell buffer and disables line editing.
     ENV    Expanded  and executed similarly to BASH_ENV (see INVOCATION above)
            when an interactive shell is invoked in posix mode.
     EXECIGNORE
            A colon-separated list of shell  patterns  (see  Pattern  Matching)
            defining the set of filenames to be ignored by command search using
            PATH.   Files  whose full pathnames match one of these patterns are
            not considered executable files for the purposes of completion  and
            command execution via PATH lookup.  This does not affect the behav-
            ior of the [, test, and [[ commands.  Full pathnames in the command
            hash table are not subject to EXECIGNORE.  Use this variable to ig-
            nore shared library files that have the executable bit set, but are
            not  executable  files.  The pattern matching honors the setting of
            the extglob shell option.
     FCEDIT
            The default editor for the fc builtin command.
     FIGNORE
            A colon-separated list of suffixes to ignore when performing  file-
            name  completion  (see  READLINE  below).   A filename whose suffix
            matches one of the entries in FIGNORE is excluded from the list  of
            matched filenames.  A sample value is ".o:~".
     FUNCNEST
            If  set  to a numeric value greater than 0, defines a maximum func-
            tion nesting level.  Function invocations that exceed this  nesting
            level cause the current command to abort.
     GLOBIGNORE
            A  colon-separated  list of patterns defining the set of file names
            to be ignored by pathname expansion.  If a file name matched  by  a
            pathname expansion pattern also matches one of the patterns in GLO-
            BIGNORE,  it  is  removed  from  the  list of matches.  The pattern
            matching honors the setting of the extglob shell option.
     GLOBSORT
            Controls how the results of pathname  expansion  are  sorted.   The
            value  of  this variable specifies the sort criteria and sort order
            for the results of pathname expansion.  If this variable  is  unset
            or  set  to the null string, pathname expansion uses the historical
            behavior of sorting by name, in ascending  lexicographic  order  as
            determined by the LC_COLLATE shell variable.

            If  set, a valid value begins with an optional +, which is ignored,
            or -, which reverses the sort order from ascending  to  descending,
            followed  by a sort specifier.  The valid sort specifiers are name,
            numeric, size, mtime, atime, ctime,  and  blocks,  which  sort  the
            files  on  name,  names in numeric rather than lexicographic order,
            file size, modification time, access time, inode change  time,  and
            number  of  blocks, respectively.  If any of the non-name keys com-
            pare as equal (e.g., if two files are the same size), sorting  uses
            the name as a secondary sort key.

            For  example, a value of -mtime sorts the results in descending or-
            der by modification time (newest first).

            The numeric specifier treats names consisting solely of  digits  as
            numbers  and sorts them using their numeric value (so "2" sorts be-
            fore "10", for example).  When using numeric, names containing non-
            digits sort after all the all-digit names and are  sorted  by  name
            using the traditional behavior.

            A  sort  specifier  of nosort disables sorting completely; bash re-
            turns the results in the order they are read from the file  system,
            ignoring any leading -.

            If  the  sort specifier is missing, it defaults to name, so a value
            of + is equivalent to the null string, and a value of  -  sorts  by
            name  in descending order.  Any invalid value restores the histori-
            cal sorting behavior.
     HISTCONTROL
            A colon-separated list of values controlling how commands are saved
            on the history list.  If the list of values  includes  ignorespace,
            lines  which begin with a space character are not saved in the his-
            tory list.  A value of ignoredups causes lines matching the  previ-
            ous history entry not to be saved.  A value of ignoreboth is short-
            hand  for  ignorespace and ignoredups.  A value of erasedups causes
            all previous lines matching the current line to be removed from the
            history list before that line is saved.  Any value not in the above
            list is ignored.  If HISTCONTROL is unset, or does  not  include  a
            valid  value,  bash saves all lines read by the shell parser on the
            history list, subject to the value of  HISTIGNORE.   If  the  first
            line  of  a  multi-line  compound command was saved, the second and
            subsequent lines are not tested, and are added to the  history  re-
            gardless  of  the  value of HISTCONTROL.  If the first line was not
            saved, the second and subsequent lines of the command are not saved
            either.
     HISTFILE
            The name of the file in which command history is saved (see HISTORY
            below).  Bash assigns a default value of ~/.bash_history.  If HIST-
            FILE is unset or null, the shell does not save the command  history
            when it exits.
     HISTFILESIZE
            The  maximum  number  of lines contained in the history file.  When
            this variable is assigned a value, the history file  is  truncated,
            if necessary, to contain no more than the number of history entries
            that total no more than that number of lines by removing the oldest
            entries.  If the history list contains multi-line entries, the his-
            tory file may contain more lines than this maximum to avoid leaving
            partial  history  entries.   The  history file is also truncated to
            this size after writing it when a shell exits  or  by  the  history
            builtin.   If the value is 0, the history file is truncated to zero
            size.  Non-numeric values and numeric values less than zero inhibit
            truncation.  The shell sets the default value to the value of HIST-
            SIZE after reading any startup files.
     HISTIGNORE
            A colon-separated list of patterns used  to  decide  which  command
            lines  should  be  saved  on  the  history list.  If a command line
            matches one of the patterns in the value of HISTIGNORE, it  is  not
            saved  on the history list.  Each pattern is anchored at the begin-
            ning of the line and must match the complete line  (bash  does  not
            implicitly  append a "*").  Each pattern is tested against the line
            after the checks specified by HISTCONTROL are applied.  In addition
            to the normal shell pattern matching characters,  "&"  matches  the
            previous  history line.  A backslash escapes the "&"; the backslash
            is removed before attempting a match.   If  the  first  line  of  a
            multi-line  compound  command  was saved, the second and subsequent
            lines are not tested, and are added to the  history  regardless  of
            the value of HISTIGNORE.  If the first line was not saved, the sec-
            ond  and subsequent lines of the command are not saved either.  The
            pattern matching honors the setting of the extglob shell option.
            HISTIGNORE subsumes some of the function of HISTCONTROL.  A pattern
            of "&" is identical to "ignoredups", and a pattern  of  "[  ]*"  is
            identical to "ignorespace".  Combining these two patterns, separat-
            ing them with a colon, provides the functionality of "ignoreboth".
     HISTSIZE
            The number of commands to remember in the command history (see HIS-
            TORY below).  If the value is 0, commands are not saved in the his-
            tory  list.   Numeric values less than zero result in every command
            being saved on the history list (there is  no  limit).   The  shell
            sets the default value to 500 after reading any startup files.
     HISTTIMEFORMAT
            If this variable is set and not null, its value is used as a format
            string for strftime(3) to print the time stamp associated with each
            history  entry  displayed by the history builtin.  If this variable
            is set, the shell writes time stamps to the history  file  so  they
            may be preserved across shell sessions.  This uses the history com-
            ment character to distinguish timestamps from other history lines.
     HOME   The  home  directory  of the current user; the default argument for
            the cd builtin command.  The value of this variable  is  also  used
            when performing tilde expansion.
     HOSTFILE
            Contains  the  name of a file in the same format as /etc/hosts that
            should be read when the shell needs to complete  a  hostname.   The
            list  of  possible  hostname  completions  may be changed while the
            shell is running; the next time hostname  completion  is  attempted
            after  the value is changed, bash adds the contents of the new file
            to the existing list.  If HOSTFILE is set, but  has  no  value,  or
            does  not name a readable file, bash attempts to read /etc/hosts to
            obtain the list of possible hostname completions.  When HOSTFILE is
            unset, bash clears the hostname list.
     IFS    The Internal Field Separator that is used for word splitting  after
            expansion  and to split lines into words with the read builtin com-
            mand.  Word splitting is described below under EXPANSION.  The  de-
            fault value is "<space><tab><newline>".
     IGNOREEOF
            Controls  the  action  of an interactive shell on receipt of an EOF
            character as the sole input.  If set, the value is  the  number  of
            consecutive EOF characters which must be typed as the first charac-
            ters  on  an  input line before bash exits.  If the variable is set
            but does not have a numeric value, or the value is  null,  the  de-
            fault  value is 10.  If it is unset, EOF signifies the end of input
            to the shell.
     INPUTRC
            The filename for the readline startup file, overriding the  default
            of ~/.inputrc (see READLINE below).
     INSIDE_EMACS
            If  this variable appears in the environment when the shell starts,
            bash assumes that it is running inside an Emacs  shell  buffer  and
            may disable line editing, depending on the value of TERM.
     LANG   Used to determine the locale category for any category not specifi-
            cally selected with a variable starting with LC_.
     LC_ALL
            This  variable  overrides the value of LANG and any other LC_ vari-
            able specifying a locale category.
     LC_COLLATE
            This variable determines the collation order used when sorting  the
            results of pathname expansion, and determines the behavior of range
            expressions,  equivalence  classes,  and collating sequences within
            pathname expansion and pattern matching.
     LC_CTYPE
            This variable determines the interpretation of characters  and  the
            behavior of character classes within pathname expansion and pattern
            matching.
     LC_MESSAGES
            This variable determines the locale used to translate double-quoted
            strings preceded by a $.
     LC_NUMERIC
            This  variable  determines the locale category used for number for-
            matting.
     LC_TIME
            This variable determines the locale category used for data and time
            formatting.
     LINES  Used by the select compound command to determine the column  length
            for  printing  selection lists.  Automatically set if the checkwin-
            size option is enabled or in an interactive shell upon receipt of a
            SIGWINCH.
     MAIL   If the value is set to a file or directory name  and  the  MAILPATH
            variable  is  not set, bash informs the user of the arrival of mail
            in the specified file or Maildir-format directory.
     MAILCHECK
            Specifies how often (in seconds) bash checks for mail.  The default
            is 60 seconds.  When it is time to check for mail, the  shell  does
            so  before  displaying the primary prompt.  If this variable is un-
            set, or set to a value that is not a number greater than  or  equal
            to zero, the shell disables mail checking.
     MAILPATH
            A  colon-separated  list  of filenames to be checked for mail.  The
            message to be printed when mail arrives in a particular file may be
            specified by separating the filename from the message with  a  "?".
            When used in the text of the message, $_ expands to the name of the
            current mailfile.  For example:
            MAILPATH='/var/mail/bfox?"You have mail":~/shell-mail?"$_ has mail!"'
            Bash  can be configured to supply a default value for this variable
            (there is no value by default), but the location of the  user  mail
            files that it uses is system dependent (e.g., /var/mail/$USER).
     OPTERR
            If  set  to  the value 1, bash displays error messages generated by
            the getopts builtin command (see  SHELL  BUILTIN  COMMANDS  below).
            OPTERR  is  initialized  to  1  each time the shell is invoked or a
            shell script is executed.
     PATH   The search path for commands.  It is a colon-separated list of  di-
            rectories in which the shell looks for commands (see COMMAND EXECU-
            TION  below).   A zero-length (null) directory name in the value of
            PATH indicates the current directory.  A null  directory  name  may
            appear  as two adjacent colons, or as an initial or trailing colon.
            The default path is system-dependent, and is set by the administra-
            tor who installs bash.  A common value is
                 /usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin
     POSIXLY_CORRECT
            If this variable is in the environment when bash starts, the  shell
            enters  posix  mode  before  reading  the  startup files, as if the
            --posix invocation option had been supplied.  If it  is  set  while
            the  shell  is  running, bash enables posix mode, as if the command
            "set -o posix" had been executed.   When  the  shell  enters  posix
            mode, it sets this variable if it was not already set.
     PROMPT_COMMAND
            If this variable is set, and is an array, the value of each set el-
            ement  is  executed  as  a  command  prior  to issuing each primary
            prompt.  If this is set but not an array  variable,  its  value  is
            used as a command to execute instead.
     PROMPT_DIRTRIM
            If set to a number greater than zero, the value is used as the num-
            ber  of  trailing directory components to retain when expanding the
            \w and \W prompt string escapes (see PROMPTING below).   Characters
            removed are replaced with an ellipsis.
     PS0    The  value  of this parameter is expanded (see PROMPTING below) and
            displayed by interactive shells after reading a command and  before
            the command is executed.
     PS1    The  value  of this parameter is expanded (see PROMPTING below) and
            used  as  the  primary  prompt  string.   The  default   value   is
            "\s-\v\$ ".
     PS2    The value of this parameter is expanded as with PS1 and used as the
            secondary prompt string.  The default is "> ".
     PS3    The  value  of  this parameter is used as the prompt for the select
            command (see SHELL GRAMMAR above).
     PS4    The value of this parameter is expanded as with PS1 and  the  value
            is  printed  before  each command bash displays during an execution
            trace.  The first character of the expanded value of PS4 is  repli-
            cated  multiple times, as necessary, to indicate multiple levels of
            indirection.  The default is "+ ".
     SHELL  This variable expands to the full pathname to the shell.  If it  is
            not set when the shell starts, bash assigns to it the full pathname
            of the current user's login shell.
     TIMEFORMAT
            The  value  of this parameter is used as a format string specifying
            how the timing information for pipelines prefixed with the time re-
            served word should be displayed.  The % character introduces an es-
            cape sequence that is expanded to a time value  or  other  informa-
            tion.   The escape sequences and their meanings are as follows; the
            brackets denote optional portions.
            %%        A literal %.
            %[p][l]R  The elapsed time in seconds.
            %[p][l]U  The number of CPU seconds spent in user mode.
            %[p][l]S  The number of CPU seconds spent in system mode.
            %P        The CPU percentage, computed as (%U + %S) / %R.

            The optional p is a digit specifying the precision, the  number  of
            fractional  digits  after  a decimal point.  A value of 0 causes no
            decimal point or fraction to be output.  time prints  at  most  six
            digits  after  the  decimal  point;  values of p greater than 6 are
            changed to 6.  If p is not specified, time prints three digits  af-
            ter the decimal point.

            The optional l specifies a longer format, including minutes, of the
            form MMmSS.FFs.  The value of p determines whether or not the frac-
            tion is included.

            If  this  variable  is  not  set,  bash acts as if it had the value
            $'\nreal\t%3lR\nuser\t%3lU\nsys\t%3lS'.  If the value is null, bash
            does not display any timing information.   A  trailing  newline  is
            added when the format string is displayed.
     TMOUT  If  set  to  a  value  greater than zero, the read builtin uses the
            value as its default timeout.  The select command terminates if in-
            put does not arrive after TMOUT seconds when input is coming from a
            terminal.  In an interactive shell, the value is interpreted as the
            number of seconds to wait for a line of  input  after  issuing  the
            primary  prompt.   Bash terminates after waiting for that number of
            seconds if a complete line of input does not arrive.
     TMPDIR
            If set, bash uses its value as the name of  a  directory  in  which
            bash creates temporary files for the shell's use.
     auto_resume
            This  variable  controls  how the shell interacts with the user and
            job control.  If this variable is set, simple  commands  consisting
            of  only a single word, without redirections, are treated as candi-
            dates for resumption of an existing stopped job.  There is no ambi-
            guity allowed; if there is more than one job beginning with or con-
            taining the word, this selects the most recently accessed job.  The
            name of a stopped job, in this context, is the command line used to
            start it, as displayed by jobs.  If set to  the  value  exact,  the
            word  must  match the name of a stopped job exactly; if set to sub-
            string, the word needs to match  a  substring  of  the  name  of  a
            stopped  job.  The substring value provides functionality analogous
            to the %?  job identifier (see JOB CONTROL below).  If set  to  any
            other  value (e.g., prefix), the word must be a prefix of a stopped
            job's name; this provides functionality analogous  to  the  %string
            job identifier.
     histchars
            The  two or three characters which control history expansion, quick
            substitution, and tokenization (see HISTORY EXPANSION below).   The
            first  character  is the history expansion character, the character
            which begins a history expansion, normally "!".  The second charac-
            ter is the quick substitution character, normally "^".  When it ap-
            pears as the first character on the line, history substitution  re-
            peats the previous command, replacing one string with another.  The
            optional  third  character  is the history comment character,  nor-
            mally "#", which indicates that the remainder of the line is a com-
            ment when it appears as the first character of a word.  The history
            comment character disables history substitution for  the  remaining
            words  on the line.  It does not necessarily cause the shell parser
            to treat the rest of the line as a comment.

   Arrays
     Bash provides one-dimensional indexed  and  associative  array  variables.
     Any  variable may be used as an indexed array; the declare builtin explic-
     itly declares an array.  There is no maximum limit on the size of  an  ar-
     ray, nor any requirement that members be indexed or assigned contiguously.
     Indexed  arrays  are referenced using arithmetic expressions that must ex-
     pand to an integer (see ARITHMETIC EVALUATION below) and  are  zero-based;
     associative  arrays are referenced using arbitrary strings.  Unless other-
     wise noted, indexed array indices must be non-negative integers.

     The shell performs parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion,
     command substitution, and  quote  removal  on  indexed  array  subscripts.
     Since  this  can  potentially  result in empty strings, subscript indexing
     treats those as expressions that evaluate to 0.

     The shell performs tilde  expansion,  parameter  and  variable  expansion,
     arithmetic  expansion, command substitution, and quote removal on associa-
     tive array subscripts.  Empty strings cannot be used as associative  array
     keys.

     Bash automatically creates an indexed array if any variable is assigned to
     using the syntax
            name[subscript]=value .
     The subscript is treated as an arithmetic expression that must evaluate to
     a  number greater than or equal to zero.  To explicitly declare an indexed
     array, use
            declare -a name
     (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).
            declare -a name[subscript]
     is also accepted; the subscript is ignored.

     Associative arrays are created using
            declare -A name
     .

     Attributes may be specified for an array variable using  the  declare  and
     readonly builtins.  Each attribute applies to all members of an array.

     Arrays  are  assigned  using compound assignments of the form name=(value1
     ... valuen), where each value may be of the form [subscript]=string.   In-
     dexed array assignments do not require anything but string.  Each value in
     the  list is expanded using the shell expansions described below under EX-
     PANSION, but values that are  valid  variable  assignments  including  the
     brackets  and subscript do not undergo brace expansion and word splitting,
     as with individual variable assignments.

     When assigning to indexed arrays, if the optional brackets  and  subscript
     are  supplied,  that index is assigned to; otherwise the index of the ele-
     ment assigned is the last index assigned to by  the  statement  plus  one.
     Indexing starts at zero.

     When assigning to an associative array, the words in a compound assignment
     may  be either assignment statements, for which the subscript is required,
     or a list of words that is interpreted as a sequence of  alternating  keys
     and  values: name=( key1 value1 key2 value2 ...).  These are treated iden-
     tically to name=( [key1]=value1 [key2]=value2 ...).  The first word in the
     list determines how the remaining words are interpreted;  all  assignments
     in  a list must be of the same type.  When using key/value pairs, the keys
     may not be missing or empty; a final missing value  is  treated  like  the
     empty string.

     This syntax is also accepted by the declare builtin.  Individual array el-
     ements  may  be  assigned to using the name[subscript]=value syntax intro-
     duced above.

     When assigning to an indexed array, if name is subscripted by  a  negative
     number,  that  number  is  interpreted as relative to one greater than the
     maximum index of name, so negative indices count back from the end of  the
     array, and an index of -1 references the last element.

     The  "+="  operator  appends to an array variable when assigning using the
     compound assignment syntax; see PARAMETERS above.

     An array element is referenced using ${name[subscript]}.  The  braces  are
     required to avoid conflicts with pathname expansion.  If subscript is @ or
     *,  the  word expands to all members of name, unless noted in the descrip-
     tion of a builtin or word expansion.  These subscripts  differ  only  when
     the  word  appears  within  double  quotes.  If the word is double-quoted,
     ${name[*]} expands to a single word with the value of  each  array  member
     separated  by  the  first  character  of  the  IFS  special  variable, and
     ${name[@]} expands each element of name to a separate  word.   When  there
     are no array members, ${name[@]} expands to nothing.  If the double-quoted
     expansion  occurs  within  a word, the expansion of the first parameter is
     joined with the beginning part of the expansion of the original word,  and
     the  expansion  of  the last parameter is joined with the last part of the
     expansion of the original word.  This is analogous to the expansion of the
     special parameters * and @ (see Special Parameters above).

     ${#name[subscript]} expands to the length of ${name[subscript]}.  If  sub-
     script is * or @, the expansion is the number of elements in the array.

     If  the  subscript used to reference an element of an indexed array evalu-
     ates to a number less than zero, it is  interpreted  as  relative  to  one
     greater  than  the  maximum  index of the array, so negative indices count
     back from the end of the array, and an index of -1 references the last el-
     ement.

     Referencing an array variable without a subscript is equivalent to  refer-
     encing the array with a subscript of 0.  Any reference to a variable using
     a valid subscript is valid; bash creates an array if necessary.

     An  array  variable  is  considered set if a subscript has been assigned a
     value.  The null string is a valid value.

     It is possible to obtain the keys (indices) of an array  as  well  as  the
     values.  ${!name[@]} and ${!name[*]} expand to the indices assigned in ar-
     ray  variable name.  The treatment when in double quotes is similar to the
     expansion of the special parameters @ and * within double quotes.

     The unset builtin is used to destroy arrays.  unset name[subscript] unsets
     the array element at index subscript, for both indexed and associative ar-
     rays.  Negative subscripts to indexed arrays are interpreted as  described
     above.  Unsetting the last element of an array variable does not unset the
     variable.   unset  name, where name is an array, removes the entire array.
     unset name[subscript] behaves differently depending on whether name is  an
     indexed  or associative array when subscript is * or @.  If name is an as-
     sociative array, this unsets the element with subscript * or @.   If  name
     is an indexed array, unset removes all of the elements but does not remove
     the array itself.

     When  using  a variable name with a subscript as an argument to a command,
     such as with unset, without using  the  word  expansion  syntax  described
     above,  (e.g., unset a[4]), the argument is subject to pathname expansion.
     Quote the argument if pathname  expansion  is  not  desired  (e.g.,  unset
     'a[4]').

     The declare, local, and readonly builtins each accept a -a option to spec-
     ify  an indexed array and a -A option to specify an associative array.  If
     both options are supplied, -A takes precedence.  The read builtin  accepts
     a  -a  option to assign a list of words read from the standard input to an
     array.  The set and declare builtins display array values in  a  way  that
     allows them to be reused as assignments.  Other builtins accept array name
     arguments  as  well  (e.g.,  mapfile);  see the descriptions of individual
     builtins below for details.  The shell provides a number of builtin  array
     variables.

EXPANSION
     Expansion  is  performed  on the command line after it has been split into
     words.  The shell performs these expansions: brace expansion, tilde expan-
     sion, parameter and variable expansion, command  substitution,  arithmetic
     expansion, word splitting, pathname expansion, and quote removal.

     The  order  of  expansions is: brace expansion; tilde expansion, parameter
     and variable expansion, arithmetic  expansion,  and  command  substitution
     (done in a left-to-right fashion); word splitting; pathname expansion; and
     quote removal.

     On  systems  that  can support it, there is an additional expansion avail-
     able: process substitution.  This is performed at the same time as  tilde,
     parameter, variable, and arithmetic expansion and command substitution.

     Quote  removal  is  always  performed  last.   It removes quote characters
     present in the original word, not ones resulting from one of the other ex-
     pansions, unless they have been quoted themselves.

     Only brace expansion, word splitting, and pathname expansion can  increase
     the  number  of  words  of the expansion; other expansions expand a single
     word to a single word.  The only exceptions to this are the expansions  of
     "$@"  and "${name[@]}", and, in most cases, $* and ${name[*]} as explained
     above (see PARAMETERS).

   Brace Expansion
     Brace expansion is a mechanism to generate  arbitrary  strings  sharing  a
     common prefix and suffix, either of which can be empty.  This mechanism is
     similar to pathname expansion, but the filenames generated need not exist.
     Patterns  to  be brace expanded are formed from an optional preamble, fol-
     lowed by either a series of comma-separated strings or a sequence  expres-
     sion  between  a  pair of braces, followed by an optional postscript.  The
     preamble is prefixed to each string contained within the braces,  and  the
     postscript  is  then  appended to each resulting string, expanding left to
     right.

     Brace expansions may be nested.  The results of each expanded  string  are
     not  sorted;  brace expansion preserves left to right order.  For example,
     a{d,c,b}e expands into "ade ace abe".

     A sequence expression takes the form x..y[..incr], where x and y  are  ei-
     ther  integers  or  single letters, and incr, an optional increment, is an
     integer.  When integers are supplied, the expression expands to each  num-
     ber between x and y, inclusive.  If either x or y begins with a zero, each
     generated  term will contain the same number of digits, zero-padding where
     necessary.  When letters are supplied,  the  expression  expands  to  each
     character  lexicographically  between  x and y, inclusive, using the C lo-
     cale.  Note that both x and y must be of the same type  (integer  or  let-
     ter).   When  the  increment is supplied, it is used as the difference be-
     tween each term.  The default increment is 1 or -1 as appropriate.

     Brace expansion is performed before any other expansions, and any  charac-
     ters  special  to  other  expansions  are  preserved in the result.  It is
     strictly textual.  Bash does not apply any syntactic interpretation to the
     context of the expansion or the text between the braces.

     A correctly-formed brace expansion must contain unquoted opening and clos-
     ing braces, and at least one unquoted comma or a  valid  sequence  expres-
     sion.  Any incorrectly formed brace expansion is left unchanged.

     A  "{"  or Q , may be quoted with a backslash to prevent its being consid-
     ered part of a brace expression.  To avoid conflicts with parameter expan-
     sion, the string "${" is not considered eligible for brace expansion,  and
     inhibits brace expansion until the closing "}".

     This  construct  is  typically used as shorthand when the common prefix of
     the strings to be generated is longer than in the above example:

            mkdir /usr/local/src/bash/{old,new,dist,bugs}
     or
            chown root /usr/{ucb/{ex,edit},lib/{ex?.?*,how_ex}}

     Brace expansion introduces a slight incompatibility with  historical  ver-
     sions  of  sh.  sh does not treat opening or closing braces specially when
     they appear as part of a word, and preserves them in the output.  Bash re-
     moves braces from words as a consequence of brace expansion.  For example,
     a word entered to sh as "file{1,2}" appears  identically  in  the  output.
     Bash outputs that word as "file1 file2" after brace expansion.  Start bash
     with  the  +B  option or disable brace expansion with the +B option to the
     set command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below) for strict  sh  compatibil-
     ity.

   Tilde Expansion
     If  a word begins with an unquoted tilde character ("~"), all of the char-
     acters preceding the first unquoted slash (or all characters, if there  is
     no  unquoted slash) are considered a tilde-prefix.  If none of the charac-
     ters in the tilde-prefix are quoted, the characters  in  the  tilde-prefix
     following  the  tilde are treated as a possible login name.  If this login
     name is the null string, the tilde is replaced with the value of the shell
     parameter HOME.  If HOME is unset, the tilde expands to the home directory
     of the user executing the shell instead.  Otherwise, the  tilde-prefix  is
     replaced with the home directory associated with the specified login name.

     If  the  tilde-prefix  is  a "~+", the value of the shell variable PWD re-
     places the tilde-prefix.  If the tilde-prefix is a "~-", the shell substi-
     tutes the value of the shell variable OLDPWD, if it is set.  If the  char-
     acters  following the tilde in the tilde-prefix consist of a number N, op-
     tionally prefixed by a "+" or a "-", the tilde-prefix is replaced with the
     corresponding element from the directory stack, as it would  be  displayed
     by the dirs builtin invoked with the characters following the tilde in the
     tilde-prefix as an argument.  If the characters following the tilde in the
     tilde-prefix  consist  of a number without a leading "+" or "-", tilde ex-
     pansion assumes "+".

     The results of tilde expansion are treated as if they were quoted, so  the
     replacement is not subject to word splitting and pathname expansion.

     If the login name is invalid, or the tilde expansion fails, the tilde-pre-
     fix is unchanged.

     Bash  checks  each variable assignment for unquoted tilde-prefixes immedi-
     ately following a : or the first =, and performs tilde expansion in  these
     cases.   Consequently, one may use filenames with tildes in assignments to
     PATH, MAILPATH, and CDPATH, and the shell assigns the expanded value.

     Bash also performs tilde expansion on words satisfying the  conditions  of
     variable  assignments  (as described above under PARAMETERS) when they ap-
     pear as arguments to simple commands.  Bash does not do this,  except  for
     the declaration commands listed above, when in posix mode.

   Parameter Expansion
     The "$" character introduces parameter expansion, command substitution, or
     arithmetic  expansion.  The parameter name or symbol to be expanded may be
     enclosed in braces, which are optional but serve to protect  the  variable
     to be expanded from characters immediately following it which could be in-
     terpreted as part of the name.

     When  braces  are used, the matching ending brace is the first "}" not es-
     caped by a backslash or within a quoted string, and not within an embedded
     arithmetic expansion, command substitution, or parameter expansion.

     The basic form of parameter expansion is

     ${parameter}

     which substitutes the value of parameter.  The braces  are  required  when
     parameter  is a positional parameter with more than one digit, or when pa-
     rameter is followed by a character which is not to be interpreted as  part
     of  its name.  The parameter is a shell parameter as described above PARA-
     METERS) or an array reference (Arrays).

     If the first character of parameter is an exclamation point (!), and para-
     meter is not a nameref, it introduces a level of indirection.   Bash  uses
     the  value formed by expanding the rest of parameter as the new parameter;
     this new parameter is then expanded and that value is used in the rest  of
     the  expansion, rather than the expansion of the original parameter.  This
     is known as indirect expansion.  The value is subject to tilde  expansion,
     parameter  expansion,  command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.  If
     parameter is a nameref, this expands to the name of the  parameter  refer-
     enced  by parameter instead of performing the complete indirect expansion,
     for compatibility.  The exceptions to this are the expansions  of  ${!pre-
     fix*} and ${!name[@]} described below.  The exclamation point must immedi-
     ately follow the left brace in order to introduce indirection.

     In  each of the cases below, word is subject to tilde expansion, parameter
     expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.

     When not performing substring expansion, using the forms documented  below
     (e.g.,  :-),  bash  tests for a parameter that is unset or null.  Omitting
     the colon tests only for a parameter that is unset.

     ${parameter:-word}
            Use Default Values.  If parameter is unset or null,  the  expansion
            of  word is substituted.  Otherwise, the value of parameter is sub-
            stituted.

     ${parameter:=word}
            Assign Default Values.  If parameter is unset or null,  the  expan-
            sion of word is assigned to parameter, and the expansion is the fi-
            nal  value of parameter.  Positional parameters and special parame-
            ters may not be assigned in this way.

     ${parameter:?word}
            Display Error if Null or Unset.  If parameter is null or unset, the
            shell writes the expansion of word (or a message to that effect  if
            word is not present) to the standard error and, if it is not inter-
            active,  exits  with  a non-zero status.  An interactive shell does
            not exit, but does not execute the command associated with the  ex-
            pansion.  Otherwise, the value of parameter is substituted.

     ${parameter:+word}
            Use  Alternate  Value.   If  parameter is null or unset, nothing is
            substituted, otherwise the expansion of word is  substituted.   The
            value of parameter is not used.

     ${parameter:offset}
     ${parameter:offset:length}
            Substring  Expansion.   Expands  to  up to length characters of the
            value of parameter starting at the character specified  by  offset.
            If  parameter is @ or *, an indexed array subscripted by @ or *, or
            an associative array name, the results differ as  described  below.
            If  :length  is omitted (the first form above), this expands to the
            substring of the value of parameter starting at the character spec-
            ified by offset and extending to the end of the value.   If  offset
            is  omitted,  it  is  treated  as 0.  If length is omitted, but the
            colon after offset is present, it is treated as 0.  length and off-
            set are arithmetic expressions (see ARITHMETIC EVALUATION below).

            If offset evaluates to a number less than zero, the value  is  used
            as  an offset in characters from the end of the value of parameter.
            If length evaluates to a number less than zero, it  is  interpreted
            as  an  offset in characters from the end of the value of parameter
            rather than a number of characters, and the expansion is the  char-
            acters between offset and that result.  Note that a negative offset
            must be separated from the colon by at least one space to avoid be-
            ing confused with the :- expansion.

            If  parameter is @ or *, the result is length positional parameters
            beginning at offset.  A negative offset is taken  relative  to  one
            greater  than the greatest positional parameter, so an offset of -1
            evaluates to the last positional parameter (or 0 if  there  are  no
            positional  parameters).  It is an expansion error if length evalu-
            ates to a number less than zero.

            If parameter is an indexed array name subscripted by @  or  *,  the
            result  is the length members of the array beginning with ${parame-
            ter[offset]}.  A negative offset is taken relative to  one  greater
            than  the maximum index of the specified array.  It is an expansion
            error if length evaluates to a number less than zero.

            Substring expansion applied to an associative array produces  unde-
            fined results.

            Substring  indexing  is zero-based unless the positional parameters
            are used, in which case the indexing starts at 1  by  default.   If
            offset is 0, and the positional parameters are used, $0 is prefixed
            to the list.

     ${!prefix*}
     ${!prefix@}
            Names  matching  prefix.   Expands  to the names of variables whose
            names begin with prefix, separated by the first  character  of  the
            IFS  special  variable.   When  @ is used and the expansion appears
            within double quotes, each variable  name  expands  to  a  separate
            word.

     ${!name[@]}
     ${!name[*]}
            List  of  array keys.  If name is an array variable, expands to the
            list of array indices (keys) assigned in name.  If name is  not  an
            array,  expands  to 0 if name is set and null otherwise.  When @ is
            used and the expansion appears within double quotes, each  key  ex-
            pands to a separate word.

     ${#parameter}
            Parameter  length.  Substitutes the length in characters of the ex-
            panded value of parameter.  If parameter is * or @, the value  sub-
            stituted  is  the number of positional parameters.  If parameter is
            an array name subscripted by * or @, the value substituted  is  the
            number  of elements in the array.  If parameter is an indexed array
            name subscripted by a negative number, that number  is  interpreted
            as  relative to one greater than the maximum index of parameter, so
            negative indices count back from the end of the array, and an index
            of -1 references the last element.

     ${parameter#word}
     ${parameter##word}
            Remove matching prefix pattern.  The word is expanded to produce  a
            pattern  just as in pathname expansion, and matched against the ex-
            panded value of parameter using the rules described  under  Pattern
            Matching  below.  If the pattern matches the beginning of the value
            of parameter, then the result of  the  expansion  is  the  expanded
            value  of  parameter  with  the  shortest matching pattern (the "#"
            case) or the longest matching pattern (the "##" case) deleted.   If
            parameter  is  @  or *, the pattern removal operation is applied to
            each positional parameter in turn, and the expansion is the  resul-
            tant list.  If parameter is an array variable subscripted with @ or
            *,  the  pattern removal operation is applied to each member of the
            array in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.

     ${parameter%word}
     ${parameter%%word}
            Remove matching suffix pattern.  The word is expanded to produce  a
            pattern  just as in pathname expansion, and matched against the ex-
            panded value of parameter using the rules described  under  Pattern
            Matching  below.   If the pattern matches a trailing portion of the
            expanded value of parameter, then the result of  the  expansion  is
            the  expanded value of parameter with the shortest matching pattern
            (the "%" case) or the longest  matching  pattern  (the  "%%"  case)
            deleted.   If parameter is @ or *, the pattern removal operation is
            applied to each positional parameter in turn, and the expansion  is
            the  resultant list.  If parameter is an array variable subscripted
            with @ or *, the pattern removal operation is applied to each  mem-
            ber of the array in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.

     ${parameter/pattern/string}
     ${parameter//pattern/string}
     ${parameter/#pattern/string}
     ${parameter/%pattern/string}
            Pattern substitution.  The pattern is expanded to produce a pattern
            and  matched  against  the expanded value of parameter as described
            under Pattern Matching below.  The longest match of pattern in  the
            expanded value is replaced with string.  string undergoes tilde ex-
            pansion,  parameter  and  variable expansion, arithmetic expansion,
            command and process substitution, and quote removal.

            In the first form above, only the  first  match  is  replaced.   If
            there  are two slashes separating parameter and pattern (the second
            form above), all matches of pattern are replaced with  string.   If
            pattern  is  preceded by # (the third form above), it must match at
            the beginning of the expanded value of parameter.   If  pattern  is
            preceded  by % (the fourth form above), it must match at the end of
            the expanded value of parameter.

            If the expansion of string is null, matches of pattern are  deleted
            and the / following pattern may be omitted.

            If  the patsub_replacement shell option is enabled using shopt, any
            unquoted instances of & in string are replaced  with  the  matching
            portion of pattern.

            Quoting any part of string inhibits replacement in the expansion of
            the  quoted  portion, including replacement strings stored in shell
            variables.  Backslash escapes & in string; the backslash is removed
            in order to permit a literal & in the  replacement  string.   Back-
            slash  can also be used to escape a backslash; \\ results in a lit-
            eral backslash in the  replacement.   Users  should  take  care  if
            string  is double-quoted to avoid unwanted interactions between the
            backslash and double-quoting, since backslash has  special  meaning
            within  double quotes.  Pattern substitution performs the check for
            unquoted & after expanding string; shell programmers  should  quote
            any  occurrences  of  &  they want to be taken literally in the re-
            placement and ensure any instances of & they want  to  be  replaced
            are unquoted.

            Like  the  pattern removal operators, double quotes surrounding the
            replacement string quote  the  expanded  characters,  while  double
            quotes  enclosing  the  entire parameter substitution do not, since
            the expansion is performed in a context that doesn't take  any  en-
            closing double quotes into account.

            If  the nocasematch shell option is enabled, the match is performed
            without regard to the case of alphabetic characters.

            If parameter is @ or *, the substitution operation  is  applied  to
            each  positional parameter in turn, and the expansion is the resul-
            tant list.  If parameter is an array variable subscripted with @ or
            *, the substitution operation is applied to each member of the  ar-
            ray in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.

     ${parameter^pattern}
     ${parameter^^pattern}
     ${parameter,pattern}
     ${parameter,,pattern}
            Case  modification.  This expansion modifies the case of alphabetic
            characters in parameter.  First, the pattern is expanded to produce
            a pattern as described below under Pattern Matching.  Bash then ex-
            amines characters in the expanded value of parameter  against  pat-
            tern  as  described below.  If a character matches the pattern, its
            case is converted.  The pattern should not attempt  to  match  more
            than one character.

            Using "^" converts lowercase letters matching pattern to uppercase;
            ","  converts matching uppercase letters to lowercase.  The ^ and ,
            variants examine the first character in the expanded value and con-
            vert its case if it matches pattern; the ^^ and ,, variants examine
            all characters in the expanded value  and  convert  each  one  that
            matches  pattern.   If  pattern is omitted, it is treated like a ?,
            which matches every character.

            If parameter is @ or *, the case modification operation is  applied
            to  each positional parameter in turn, and the expansion is the re-
            sultant list.  If parameter is an array variable subscripted with @
            or *, the case modification operation is applied to each member  of
            the array in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.

     ${parameter@operator}
            Parameter transformation.  The expansion is either a transformation
            of  the  value  of parameter or information about parameter itself,
            depending on the value of operator.  Each operator is a single let-
            ter:
            U      The expansion is a string that is  the  value  of  parameter
                   with lowercase alphabetic characters converted to uppercase.
            u      The  expansion  is  a  string that is the value of parameter
                   with the first character converted to uppercase,  if  it  is
                   alphabetic.
            L      The  expansion  is  a  string that is the value of parameter
                   with uppercase alphabetic characters converted to lowercase.
            Q      The expansion is a string that is  the  value  of  parameter
                   quoted in a format that can be reused as input.
            E      The  expansion  is  a  string that is the value of parameter
                   with backslash escape sequences expanded as with the  $'...'
                   quoting mechanism.
            P      The  expansion  is  a string that is the result of expanding
                   the value of parameter as if it were a  prompt  string  (see
                   PROMPTING below).
            A      The  expansion  is  a  string  in  the form of an assignment
                   statement or declare command that, if  evaluated,  recreates
                   parameter with its attributes and value.
            K      Produces  a  possibly-quoted version of the value of parame-
                   ter, except that it prints the values of indexed  and  asso-
                   ciative  arrays as a sequence of quoted key-value pairs (see
                   Arrays above).  The keys and values are quoted in  a  format
                   that can be reused as input.
            a      The  expansion  is a string consisting of flag values repre-
                   senting parameter's attributes.
            k      Like the K transformation, but expands the keys  and  values
                   of  indexed  and  associative arrays to separate words after
                   word splitting.

            If parameter is @ or *, the operation is applied to each positional
            parameter in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.  If pa-
            rameter is an array variable subscripted with @ or *, the operation
            is applied to each member of the array in turn, and  the  expansion
            is the resultant list.

            The  result of the expansion is subject to word splitting and path-
            name expansion as described below.

   Command Substitution
     Command substitution allows the output of a command to replace the command
     itself.  There are two standard forms:

            $(command)
     or (deprecated)
            `command`.

     Bash performs the expansion by executing command in a subshell environment
     and replacing the command substitution with the  standard  output  of  the
     command,  with  any  trailing newlines deleted.  Embedded newlines are not
     deleted, but they may be removed during word splitting.  The command  sub-
     stitution  $(cat  file)  can  be replaced by the equivalent but faster $(<
     file).

     With the old-style backquote form of substitution, backslash  retains  its
     literal  meaning  except when followed by $, `, or \.  The first backquote
     not preceded by a backslash terminates the command substitution.  When us-
     ing the $(command) form, all characters between the  parentheses  make  up
     the command; none are treated specially.

     There is an alternate form of command substitution:

            ${c command;}

     which  executes  command in the current execution environment and captures
     its output, again with trailing newlines removed.

     The character c following the open brace must be a space, tab, newline, or
     |, and the close brace must be in a position where a reserved word may ap-
     pear (i.e., preceded by a command terminator such as semicolon).  Bash al-
     lows the close brace to be joined to the remaining characters in the  word
     without  being  followed by a shell metacharacter as a reserved word would
     usually require.

     Any side effects of command take effect immediately in the current  execu-
     tion  environment and persist in the current environment after the command
     completes (e.g., the exit builtin exits the shell).

     This type of command substitution superficially resembles executing an un-
     named shell function: local variables are created as when a shell function
     is executing, and the return builtin forces command to complete;  however,
     the  rest  of  the execution environment, including the positional parame-
     ters, is shared with the caller.

     If the first character following the open brace is a |, the construct  ex-
     pands  to  the  value  of the REPLY shell variable after command executes,
     without removing any trailing newlines, and the standard output of command
     remains the same as in the calling shell.  Bash creates REPLY as  an  ini-
     tially-unset  local  variable when command executes, and restores REPLY to
     the value it had before the command substitution after command  completes,
     as with any local variable.

     Command  substitutions  may  be nested.  To nest when using the backquoted
     form, escape the inner backquotes with backslashes.

     If the substitution appears within double quotes, bash  does  not  perform
     word splitting and pathname expansion on the results.

   Arithmetic Expansion
     Arithmetic  expansion  evaluates  an arithmetic expression and substitutes
     the result.  The format for arithmetic expansion is:

            $((expression))

     The expression undergoes the same expansions as if it were  within  double
     quotes,  but  unescaped  double  quote  characters  in  expression are not
     treated specially and are removed.  All tokens in the  expression  undergo
     parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, and quote removal.
     The result is treated as the arithmetic expression to be evaluated.  Since
     the  way  Bash  handles  double  quotes  can  potentially  result in empty
     strings, arithmetic expansion treats those as expressions that evaluate to
     0.  Arithmetic expansions may be nested.

     The evaluation is performed according to  the  rules  listed  below  under
     ARITHMETIC EVALUATION.  If expression is invalid, bash prints a message to
     standard  error indicating failure, does not perform the substitution, and
     does not execute the command associated with the expansion.

   Process Substitution
     Process substitution allows a process's input or output to be referred  to
     using  a  filename.  It takes the form of <(list) or >(list).  The process
     list is run asynchronously, and its input or output appears as a filename.
     This filename is passed as an argument to the current command as  the  re-
     sult of the expansion.

     If  the >(list) form is used, writing to the file provides input for list.
     If the <(list) form is used, reading the file obtains the output of  list.
     No space may appear between the < or > and the left parenthesis, otherwise
     the construct would be interpreted as a redirection.

     Process substitution is supported on systems that support named pipes (FI-
     FOs) or the /dev/fd method of naming open files.

     When  available, process substitution is performed simultaneously with pa-
     rameter and variable expansion, command substitution, and  arithmetic  ex-
     pansion.

   Word Splitting
     The  shell scans the results of parameter expansion, command substitution,
     and arithmetic expansion that did not occur within double quotes for  word
     splitting.  Words that were not expanded are not split.

     The  shell treats each character of IFS as a delimiter, and splits the re-
     sults of the other expansions into words using these characters  as  field
     terminators.

     An  IFS  whitespace  character is whitespace as defined above (see Defini-
     tions) that appears in the value of IFS.  Space, tab, and newline are  al-
     ways  considered IFS whitespace, even if they don't appear in the locale's
     space category.

     If  IFS  is  unset,  field  splitting  acts   as   if   its   value   were
     <space><tab><newline>,  and treats these characters as IFS whitespace.  If
     the value of IFS is null, no word splitting occurs, but implicit null  ar-
     guments (see below) are still removed.

     Word  splitting  begins by removing sequences of IFS whitespace characters
     from the beginning and end of the results of the previous expansions, then
     splits the remaining words.

     If the value of IFS consists solely of IFS whitespace, any sequence of IFS
     whitespace characters delimits a field, so a field consists of  characters
     that  are  not  unquoted  IFS whitespace, and null fields result only from
     quoting.

     If IFS contains a non-whitespace character,  then  any  character  in  the
     value  of  IFS  that  is  not  IFS whitespace, along with any adjacent IFS
     whitespace characters, delimits a field.  This means  that  adjacent  non-
     IFS-whitespace  delimiters produce a null field.  A sequence of IFS white-
     space characters also delimits a field.

     Explicit null arguments ("" or '') are retained and passed to commands  as
     empty  strings.   Unquoted implicit null arguments, resulting from the ex-
     pansion of parameters that have no values, are removed.  Expanding a para-
     meter with no value within double quotes produces a null field,  which  is
     retained and passed to a command as an empty string.

     When  a  quoted null argument appears as part of a word whose expansion is
     non-null, word splitting removes the null argument  portion,  leaving  the
     non-null  expansion.   That  is,  the  word "-d''" becomes "-d" after word
     splitting and null argument removal.

   Pathname Expansion
     After word splitting, unless the -f option has been set, bash  scans  each
     word  for the characters *, ?, and [.  If one of these characters appears,
     and is not quoted, then the word is regarded as a  pattern,  and  replaced
     with a sorted list of filenames matching the pattern (see Pattern Matching
     below) subject to the value of the GLOBSORT shell variable.

     If  no  matching filenames are found, and the shell option nullglob is not
     enabled, the word is left unchanged.  If the nullglob option is  set,  and
     no  matches  are found, the word is removed.  If the failglob shell option
     is set, and no matches are found, bash prints an error  message  and  does
     not  execute  the command.  If the shell option nocaseglob is enabled, the
     match is performed without regard to the case of alphabetic characters.

     When a pattern is used for pathname expansion, the character  "."  at  the
     start  of  a name or immediately following a slash must be matched explic-
     itly, unless the shell option dotglob is set.  In order to match the file-
     names . and .., the pattern must begin with "." (for example, ".?"),  even
     if dotglob is set.  If the globskipdots shell option is enabled, the file-
     names  .  and .. never match, even if the pattern begins with a ".".  When
     not matching pathnames, the "." character is not treated specially.

     When matching a pathname, the slash character must always be  matched  ex-
     plicitly  by a slash in the pattern, but in other matching contexts it can
     be matched by a special pattern character as described below under Pattern
     Matching.

     See the description of shopt below under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS for a  de-
     scription of the nocaseglob, nullglob, globskipdots, failglob, and dotglob
     shell options.

     The  GLOBIGNORE  shell  variable  may  be used to restrict the set of file
     names matching a pattern.  If GLOBIGNORE is set, each matching  file  name
     that  also  matches  one of the patterns in GLOBIGNORE is removed from the
     list of matches.  If the nocaseglob option is set,  the  matching  against
     the patterns in GLOBIGNORE is performed without regard to case.  The file-
     names  .  and  ..  are always ignored when GLOBIGNORE is set and not null.
     However, setting GLOBIGNORE to a non-null value has the effect of enabling
     the dotglob shell option, so all other  filenames  beginning  with  a  "."
     match.   To  get  the  old behavior of ignoring filenames beginning with a
     ".", make ".*"  one of the patterns in GLOBIGNORE.  The dotglob option  is
     disabled when GLOBIGNORE is unset.  The GLOBIGNORE pattern matching honors
     the setting of the extglob shell option.

     The value of the GLOBSORT shell variable controls how the results of path-
     name expansion are sorted, as described above under Shell Variables.

     Pattern Matching

     Any  character  that  appears in a pattern, other than the special pattern
     characters described below, matches itself.  The NUL character may not oc-
     cur in a pattern.  A backslash escapes the following character; the escap-
     ing backslash is discarded when matching.  The special pattern  characters
     must be quoted if they are to be matched literally.

     The special pattern characters have the following meanings:

            *      Matches  any  string,  including  the null string.  When the
                   globstar shell option is enabled, and * is used in  a  path-
                   name  expansion  context,  two  adjacent *s used as a single
                   pattern match all files and zero  or  more  directories  and
                   subdirectories.   If  followed by a /, two adjacent *s match
                   only directories and subdirectories.
            ?      Matches any single character.
            [...]  Matches any one  of  the  characters  enclosed  between  the
                   brackets.  This is known as a bracket expression and matches
                   a single character.  A pair of characters separated by a hy-
                   phen  denotes  a  range expression; any character that falls
                   between those two characters, inclusive, using  the  current
                   locale's  collating sequence and character set, matches.  If
                   the first character following the [ is a !  or a ^ then  any
                   character  not  within the range matches.  To match a -, in-
                   clude it as the first or last  character  in  the  set.   To
                   match a ], include it as the first character in the set.

                   The  sorting  order  of characters in range expressions, and
                   the characters included in the range, are determined by  the
                   current  locale  and  the values of the LC_COLLATE or LC_ALL
                   shell variables, if set.  To obtain the  traditional  inter-
                   pretation of range expressions, where [a-d] is equivalent to
                   [abcd],  set  the  value  of  the LC_COLLATE or LC_ALL shell
                   variables to C, or enable the globasciiranges shell option.

                   Within a bracket expression, character classes can be speci-
                   fied using the syntax [:class:], where class is one  of  the
                   following classes defined in the POSIX standard:

                   alnum  alpha ascii blank cntrl digit graph lower print punct
                   space upper word xdigit

                   A character class matches any character  belonging  to  that
                   class.   The  word  character class matches letters, digits,
                   and the character _.

                   Within a bracket expression, an  equivalence  class  can  be
                   specified  using the syntax [=c=], which matches all charac-
                   ters with the same collation weight (as defined by the  cur-
                   rent locale) as the character c.

                   Within  a  bracket expression, the syntax [.symbol.] matches
                   the collating symbol symbol.

     If the extglob shell option is enabled using the shopt builtin, the  shell
     recognizes  several extended pattern matching operators.  In the following
     description, a pattern-list is a list of one or more patterns separated by
     a |.  Composite patterns may be formed using one or more of the  following
     sub-patterns:

            ?(pattern-list)
                   Matches zero or one occurrence of the given patterns.
            *(pattern-list)
                   Matches zero or more occurrences of the given patterns.
            +(pattern-list)
                   Matches one or more occurrences of the given patterns.
            @(pattern-list)
                   Matches one of the given patterns.
            !(pattern-list)
                   Matches anything except one of the given patterns.

     The extglob option changes the behavior of the parser, since the parenthe-
     ses  are  normally treated as operators with syntactic meaning.  To ensure
     that extended matching patterns are parsed correctly, make sure that  ext-
     glob is enabled before parsing constructs containing the patterns, includ-
     ing shell functions and command substitutions.

     When  matching  filenames,  the dotglob shell option determines the set of
     filenames that are tested: when dotglob is enabled, the set  of  filenames
     includes  all  files beginning with ".", but . and .. must be matched by a
     pattern or sub-pattern that begins with a dot; when it  is  disabled,  the
     set  does  not include any filenames beginning with "." unless the pattern
     or sub-pattern begins with a ".".  If the globskipdots shell option is en-
     abled, the filenames . and .. never appear in the set.  As above, "." only
     has a special meaning when matching filenames.

     Complicated extended pattern matching against long strings is slow,  espe-
     cially when the patterns contain alternations and the strings contain mul-
     tiple  matches.   Using separate matches against shorter strings, or using
     arrays of strings instead of a single long string, may be faster.

   Quote Removal
     After the preceding expansions, all unquoted occurrences of the characters
     \, ', and " that did not result from one of the above expansions  are  re-
     moved.

REDIRECTION
     Before a command is executed, its input and output may be redirected using
     a special notation interpreted by the shell.  Redirection allows commands'
     file  handles to be duplicated, opened, closed, made to refer to different
     files, and can change the files the command  reads  from  and  writes  to.
     When  used  with the exec builtin, redirections modify file handles in the
     current shell execution environment.  The following redirection  operators
     may  precede  or  appear  anywhere within a simple command or may follow a
     command.  Redirections are processed in the order they appear,  from  left
     to right.

     Each  redirection that may be preceded by a file descriptor number may in-
     stead be preceded by a word of the form {varname}.  In this case, for each
     redirection operator except >&- and <&-, the shell allocates  a  file  de-
     scriptor  greater than or equal to 10 and assigns it to varname.  If {var-
     name} precedes >&- or <&-, the value of varname defines the file  descrip-
     tor  to  close.  If {varname} is supplied, the redirection persists beyond
     the scope of the command, which allows the shell programmer to manage  the
     file  descriptor's  lifetime manually without using the exec builtin.  The
     varredir_close shell option manages this behavior.

     In the following descriptions, if the file descriptor number  is  omitted,
     and  the  first character of the redirection operator is "<", the redirec-
     tion refers to the standard input (file descriptor 0).  If the first char-
     acter of the redirection operator is ">", the redirection  refers  to  the
     standard output (file descriptor 1).

     The word following the redirection operator in the following descriptions,
     unless  otherwise noted, is subjected to brace expansion, tilde expansion,
     parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, arithmetic  expan-
     sion,  quote  removal,  pathname expansion, and word splitting.  If it ex-
     pands to more than one word, bash reports an error.

     The order of redirections is significant.  For example, the command

            ls > dirlist 2>&1

     directs both standard output and standard error to the file dirlist, while
     the command

            ls 2>&1 > dirlist

     directs only the standard output to file dirlist, because the standard er-
     ror was directed to the standard output before  the  standard  output  was
     redirected to dirlist.

     Bash  handles  several  filenames specially when they are used in redirec-
     tions, as described in the following table.  If the  operating  system  on
     which bash is running provides these special files, bash uses them; other-
     wise it emulates them internally with the behavior described below.

            /dev/fd/fd
                   If fd is a valid integer, duplicate file descriptor fd.
            /dev/stdin
                   File descriptor 0 is duplicated.
            /dev/stdout
                   File descriptor 1 is duplicated.
            /dev/stderr
                   File descriptor 2 is duplicated.
            /dev/tcp/host/port
                   If host is a valid hostname or Internet address, and port is
                   an  integer  port  number  or service name, bash attempts to
                   open the corresponding TCP socket.
            /dev/udp/host/port
                   If host is a valid hostname or Internet address, and port is
                   an integer port number or service  name,  bash  attempts  to
                   open the corresponding UDP socket.

     A failure to open or create a file causes the redirection to fail.

     Redirections  using  file  descriptors  greater than 9 should be used with
     care, as they may conflict with file descriptors  the  shell  uses  inter-
     nally.

   Redirecting Input
     Redirecting  input opens the file whose name results from the expansion of
     word for reading on file descriptor n, or the  standard  input  (file  de-
     scriptor 0) if n is not specified.

     The general format for redirecting input is:

            [n]<word

   Redirecting Output
     Redirecting output opens the file whose name results from the expansion of
     word  for  writing  on file descriptor n, or the standard output (file de-
     scriptor 1) if n is not specified.  If the file does not exist it is  cre-
     ated; if it does exist it is truncated to zero size.

     The general format for redirecting output is:

            [n]>word

     If  the  redirection  operator  is  >, and the noclobber option to the set
     builtin command has been enabled, the redirection fails if the file  whose
     name  results from the expansion of word exists and is a regular file.  If
     the redirection operator is >|, or the redirection operator is >  and  the
     noclobber  option  to  the  set  builtin is not enabled, bash attempts the
     redirection even if the file named by word exists.

   Appending Redirected Output
     Redirecting output in this fashion opens the file whose name results  from
     the  expansion of word for appending on file descriptor n, or the standard
     output (file descriptor 1) if n is not specified.  If the  file  does  not
     exist it is created.

     The general format for appending output is:

            [n]>>word

   Redirecting Standard Output and Standard Error
     This  construct redirects both the standard output (file descriptor 1) and
     the standard error output (file descriptor 2) to the file  whose  name  is
     the expansion of word.

     There are two formats for redirecting standard output and standard error:

            &>word
     and
            >&word

     Of the two forms, the first is preferred.  This is semantically equivalent
     to

            >word 2>&1

     When  using  the second form, word may not expand to a number or -.  If it
     does, other redirection operators apply (see Duplicating File  Descriptors
     below) for compatibility reasons.

   Appending Standard Output and Standard Error
     This  construct  appends  both the standard output (file descriptor 1) and
     the standard error output (file descriptor 2) to the file  whose  name  is
     the expansion of word.

     The format for appending standard output and standard error is:

            &>>word

     This is semantically equivalent to

            >>word 2>&1

     (see Duplicating File Descriptors below).

   Here Documents
     This  type  of redirection instructs the shell to read input from the cur-
     rent source until it reads a  line  containing  only  delimiter  (with  no
     trailing  blanks).  All of the lines read up to that point then become the
     standard input (or file descriptor n if n is specified) for a command.

     The format of here-documents is:

            [n]<<[-]word
                    here-document
            delimiter

     The shell does not perform parameter and variable expansion, command  sub-
     stitution, arithmetic expansion, or pathname expansion on word.

     If  any  part  of word is quoted, the delimiter is the result of quote re-
     moval on word, and the lines in the here-document are  not  expanded.   If
     word is unquoted, the delimiter is word itself, and the here-document text
     is treated similarly to a double-quoted string: all lines of the here-doc-
     ument  are  subjected  to  parameter  expansion, command substitution, and
     arithmetic expansion, the character sequence \<newline> is treated  liter-
     ally,  and  \  must  be used to quote the characters \, $, and `; however,
     double quote characters have no special meaning.

     If the redirection operator is <<-, then the shell strips all leading  tab
     characters  from  input lines and the line containing delimiter.  This al-
     lows here-documents within shell scripts to be indented in a natural fash-
     ion.

     If the delimiter is not quoted, the \<newline> sequence is  treated  as  a
     line  continuation:  the two lines are joined and the backslash-newline is
     removed.  This happens while reading the here-document, before  the  check
     for the ending delimiter, so joined lines can form the end delimiter.

   Here Strings
     A variant of here documents, the format is:

            [n]<<<word

     The word undergoes tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, com-
     mand  substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal.  Pathname ex-
     pansion and word splitting are not performed.  The result is supplied as a
     single string, with a newline appended, to the command on its standard in-
     put (or file descriptor n if n is specified).

   Duplicating File Descriptors
     The redirection operator

            [n]<&word

     is used to duplicate input file descriptors.  If word expands  to  one  or
     more  digits, file descriptor n is made to be a copy of that file descrip-
     tor.  It is a redirection error if the digits in word  do  not  specify  a
     file descriptor open for input.  If word evaluates to -, file descriptor n
     is  closed.  If n is not specified, this uses the standard input (file de-
     scriptor 0).

     The operator

            [n]>&word

     is used similarly to duplicate output file descriptors.  If n is not spec-
     ified, this uses the standard output (file descriptor 1).  It is  a  redi-
     rection  error if the digits in word do not specify a file descriptor open
     for output.  If word evaluates to -, file descriptor n is  closed.   As  a
     special  case,  if  n  is omitted, and word does not expand to one or more
     digits or -, this redirects the standard output and standard error as  de-
     scribed previously.

   Moving File Descriptors
     The redirection operator

            [n]<&digit-

     moves  the file descriptor digit to file descriptor n, or the standard in-
     put (file descriptor 0) if n is not specified.  digit is closed after  be-
     ing duplicated to n.

     Similarly, the redirection operator

            [n]>&digit-

     moves the file descriptor digit to file descriptor n, or the standard out-
     put (file descriptor 1) if n is not specified.

   Opening File Descriptors for Reading and Writing
     The redirection operator

            [n]<>word

     opens  the  file  whose name is the expansion of word for both reading and
     writing on file descriptor n, or on file descriptor 0 if n is  not  speci-
     fied.  If the file does not exist, it is created.

ALIASES
     Aliases  allow a string to be substituted for a word that is in a position
     in the input where it can be the first word of a simple command.   Aliases
     have names and corresponding values that are set and unset using the alias
     and unalias builtin commands (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).

     If  the  shell reads an unquoted word in the right position, it checks the
     word to see if it matches an alias name.  If it  matches,  the  shell  re-
     places  the  word  with the alias value, and reads that value as if it had
     been read instead of the word.  The shell doesn't look at  any  characters
     following the word before attempting alias substitution.

     The characters /, $, `, and = and any of the shell metacharacters or quot-
     ing characters listed above may not appear in an alias name.  The replace-
     ment  text  may contain any valid shell input, including shell metacharac-
     ters.  The first word of the replacement text is tested for aliases, but a
     word that is identical to an alias being expanded is not expanded a second
     time.  This means that one may alias ls to ls -F, for instance,  and  bash
     does not try to recursively expand the replacement text.

     If  the last character of the alias value is a blank, the shell checks the
     next command word following the alias for alias expansion.

     Aliases are created and listed with the alias command,  and  removed  with
     the unalias command.

     There is no mechanism for using arguments in the replacement text.  If ar-
     guments are needed, use a shell function (see FUNCTIONS below) instead.

     Aliases are not expanded when the shell is not interactive, unless the ex-
     pand_aliases shell option is set using shopt (see the description of shopt
     under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).

     The  rules  concerning the definition and use of aliases are somewhat con-
     fusing.  Bash always reads at least one complete line of  input,  and  all
     lines  that  make  up a compound command, before executing any of the com-
     mands on that line or the compound command.  Aliases are expanded  when  a
     command  is read, not when it is executed.  Therefore, an alias definition
     appearing on the same line as another command does not take  effect  until
     the  shell reads the next line of input, and an alias definition in a com-
     pound command does not take effect until the shell parses and executes the
     entire compound command.  The commands following the alias  definition  on
     that  line,  or in the rest of a compound command, are not affected by the
     new alias.  This behavior is also an issue when  functions  are  executed.
     Aliases  are  expanded  when  a  function definition is read, not when the
     function is executed, because a function definition is itself  a  command.
     As  a  consequence,  aliases defined in a function are not available until
     after that function is executed.  To be safe, always put alias definitions
     on a separate line, and do not use alias in compound commands.

     For almost every purpose, shell functions are preferable to aliases.

FUNCTIONS
     A shell function, defined as described above under SHELL GRAMMAR, stores a
     series of commands for later execution.  When the name of a shell function
     is used as a simple command name, the shell executes the list of  commands
     associated with that function name.  Functions are executed in the context
     of  the  calling  shell; there is no new process created to interpret them
     (contrast this with the execution of a shell script).

     When a function is executed, the arguments to the function become the  po-
     sitional  parameters during its execution.  The special parameter # is up-
     dated to reflect the new positional parameters.  Special  parameter  0  is
     unchanged.   The first element of the FUNCNAME variable is set to the name
     of the function while the function is executing.

     All other aspects of the shell execution environment are identical between
     a function and its caller with these  exceptions:  the  DEBUG  and  RETURN
     traps  (see  the  description of the trap builtin under SHELL BUILTIN COM-
     MANDS below) are not inherited unless the  function  has  been  given  the
     trace  attribute (see the description of the declare builtin below) or the
     -o functrace shell option has been enabled with the set builtin (in  which
     case  all  functions inherit the DEBUG and RETURN traps), and the ERR trap
     is not inherited unless the -o errtrace shell option has been enabled.

     Variables local to the function are declared with the local  builtin  com-
     mand (local variables).  Ordinarily, variables and their values are shared
     between the function and its caller.  If a variable is declared local, the
     variable's  visible  scope is restricted to that function and its children
     (including the functions it calls).

     In the following description, the current scope is a currently-  executing
     function.   Previous  scopes  consist of that function's caller and so on,
     back to the "global" scope, where the shell is  not  executing  any  shell
     function.   A  local  variable at the current scope is a variable declared
     using the local or declare builtins in the function that is currently exe-
     cuting.

     Local variables "shadow" variables with the same name declared at previous
     scopes.  For instance, a local variable declared in a function hides vari-
     ables with the same name declared at  previous  scopes,  including  global
     variables: references and assignments refer to the local variable, leaving
     the  variables  at previous scopes unmodified.  When the function returns,
     the global variable is once again visible.

     The shell uses dynamic scoping to control a variable's  visibility  within
     functions.  With dynamic scoping, visible variables and their values are a
     result  of  the  sequence of function calls that caused execution to reach
     the current function.  The value of a variable that a  function  sees  de-
     pends  on  its value within its caller, if any, whether that caller is the
     global scope or another shell function.  This is also the value that a lo-
     cal variable declaration shadows, and the value that is restored when  the
     function returns.

     For example, if a variable var is declared as local in function func1, and
     func1  calls  another  function  func2, references to var made from within
     func2 resolve to the local variable var from func1, shadowing  any  global
     variable named var.

     The unset builtin also acts using the same dynamic scope: if a variable is
     local  to the current scope, unset unsets it; otherwise the unset will re-
     fer to the variable found in any calling scope as described above.   If  a
     variable  at the current local scope is unset, it remains so (appearing as
     unset) until it is reset in that scope  or  until  the  function  returns.
     Once  the  function  returns,  any  instance of the variable at a previous
     scope becomes visible.  If the unset acts on  a  variable  at  a  previous
     scope,  any  instance  of a variable with that name that had been shadowed
     becomes visible (see below how the  localvar_unset  shell  option  changes
     this behavior).

     The FUNCNEST variable, if set to a numeric value greater than 0, defines a
     maximum  function  nesting  level.   Function  invocations that exceed the
     limit cause the entire command to abort.

     If the builtin command return is executed in a function, the function com-
     pletes and execution resumes with the  next  command  after  the  function
     call.   If  return  is supplied a numeric argument, that is the function's
     return status; otherwise the function's return status is the  exit  status
     of  the  last  command executed before the return.  Any command associated
     with the RETURN trap is executed before execution resumes.  When  a  func-
     tion  completes,  the  values of the positional parameters and the special
     parameter # are restored to the values they had prior  to  the  function's
     execution.

     The  -f  option  to the declare or typeset builtin commands lists function
     names and definitions.  The -F option to  declare  or  typeset  lists  the
     function  names  only  (and optionally the source file and line number, if
     the extdebug shell option is enabled).  Functions may be exported so  that
     child shell processes (those created when executing a separate shell invo-
     cation)  automatically  have them defined with the -f option to the export
     builtin.  The -f option to the unset builtin deletes  a  function  defini-
     tion.

     Functions  may  be  recursive.  The FUNCNEST variable may be used to limit
     the depth of the function call stack and restrict the number  of  function
     invocations.  By default, bash imposes no limit on the number of recursive
     calls.

ARITHMETIC EVALUATION
     The  shell  allows  arithmetic  expressions to be evaluated, under certain
     circumstances (see the let and declare builtin commands, the  ((  compound
     command,  the  arithmetic  for  command,  the  [[ conditional command, and
     Arithmetic Expansion).

     Evaluation is done in the largest fixed-width integers available, with  no
     check  for overflow, though division by 0 is trapped and flagged as an er-
     ror.  The operators and their precedence, associativity,  and  values  are
     the same as in the C language.  The following list of operators is grouped
     into levels of equal-precedence operators.  The levels are listed in order
     of decreasing precedence.

     id++ id--
            variable post-increment and post-decrement
     ++id --id
            variable pre-increment and pre-decrement
     - +    unary minus and plus
     ! ~    logical and bitwise negation
     **     exponentiation
     * / %  multiplication, division, remainder
     + -    addition, subtraction
     << >>  left and right bitwise shifts
     <= >= < >
            comparison
     == !=  equality and inequality
     &      bitwise AND
     ^      bitwise exclusive OR
     |      bitwise OR
     &&     logical AND
     ||     logical OR
     expr?expr:expr
            conditional operator
     = *= /= %= += -= <<= >>= &= ^= |=
            assignment
     expr1 , expr2
            comma

     Shell  variables are allowed as operands; parameter expansion is performed
     before the expression is evaluated.  Within an expression, shell variables
     may also be referenced by name without using the parameter expansion  syn-
     tax.   This means you can use "x", where x is a shell variable name, in an
     arithmetic expression, and the shell will evaluate its value as an expres-
     sion and use the result.  A shell variable that is null or unset evaluates
     to 0 when referenced by name in an expression.

     The value of a variable is evaluated as an arithmetic expression  when  it
     is  referenced,  or  when  a variable which has been given the integer at-
     tribute using declare -i is assigned a value.  A null value  evaluates  to
     0.   A  shell variable need not have its integer attribute turned on to be
     used in an expression.

     Integer constants follow the C language definition,  without  suffixes  or
     character  constants.  Constants with a leading 0 are interpreted as octal
     numbers.  A leading 0x or 0X denotes hexadecimal.  Otherwise, numbers take
     the form [base#]n, where the optional base is a decimal number  between  2
     and  64  representing the arithmetic base, and n is a number in that base.
     If base# is omitted, then base 10 is used.  When specifying n, if  a  non-
     digit is required, the digits greater than 9 are represented by the lower-
     case  letters, the uppercase letters, @, and _, in that order.  If base is
     less than or equal to 36, lowercase and uppercase letters may be used  in-
     terchangeably to represent numbers between 10 and 35.

     Operators are evaluated in precedence order.  Sub-expressions in parenthe-
     ses are evaluated first and may override the precedence rules above.

CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS
     Conditional  expressions  are used by the [[ compound command and the test
     and [ builtin commands to test file  attributes  and  perform  string  and
     arithmetic  comparisons.  The test and [ commands determine their behavior
     based on the number of arguments; see the descriptions of  those  commands
     for any other command-specific actions.

     Expressions  are  formed  from the unary or binary primaries listed below.
     Unary expressions are often used to examine the status of a file or  shell
     variable.   Binary  operators  are  used for string, numeric, and file at-
     tribute comparisons.

     Bash handles several filenames specially when they  are  used  in  expres-
     sions.   If  the  operating system on which bash is running provides these
     special files, bash will use them; otherwise it will emulate  them  inter-
     nally  with this behavior: If any file argument to one of the primaries is
     of the form /dev/fd/n, then bash checks file descriptor n.   If  the  file
     argument  to  one  of  the primaries is one of /dev/stdin, /dev/stdout, or
     /dev/stderr, bash checks file descriptor 0, 1, or 2, respectively.

     Unless otherwise specified, primaries that operate on  files  follow  sym-
     bolic  links  and  operate on the target of the link, rather than the link
     itself.

     When used with [[, or when the shell is in posix mode, the < and >  opera-
     tors  sort  lexicographically using the current locale.  When the shell is
     not in posix mode, the test command sorts using ASCII ordering.

            True if file exists.
     -b file
            True if file exists and is a block special file.
     -c file
            True if file exists and is a character special file.
     -d file
            True if file exists and is a directory.
     -e file
            True if file exists.
     -f file
            True if file exists and is a regular file.

     -h file
            True if file exists and is a symbolic link.
     -k file
            True if file exists and its "sticky" bit is set.

            True if file exists and its set-user-id bit is set.
     -w file
            True if file exists and is writable.
     -x file
            True if file exists and is executable.
     -G file
            True if file exists and is owned by the effective group id.

            cessed.
     -O file
            True if file exists and is owned by the effective user id.
     -S file
            True if file exists and is a socket.
     -o optname
            True  if  the shell option optname is enabled.  See the list of op-
            tions under the description of the -o option to the set builtin be-
            low.
     -v varname
            True if the shell variable varname is  set  (has  been  assigned  a
            value).   If  varname is an indexed array variable name subscripted
            by @ or *, this returns true if the array has any set elements.  If
            varname is an associative array variable name subscripted by  @  or
            *, this returns true if an element with that key is set.
     -R varname
            True if the shell variable varname is set and is a name reference.
     -z string
            True if the length of string is zero.
     string
     -n string
            True if the length of string is non-zero.

     string1 == string2
     string1 = string2
            True if the strings are equal.  = should be used with the test com-
            mand  for  POSIX  conformance.  When used with the [[ command, this
            performs pattern matching as described above (Compound Commands).
     string1 != string2
            True if the strings are not equal.
     string1 < string2
            True if string1 sorts before string2 lexicographically.
     string1 > string2
            True if string1 sorts after string2 lexicographically.

     file1 -ef file2
            True if file1 and file2 refer to the same device and inode numbers.
     file1 -nt file2
            True if file1 is newer (according to modification date) than file2,
            or if file1 exists and file2 does not.
     file1 -ot file2
            True if file1 is older than file2, or if  file2  exists  and  file1
            does not.

     arg1 OP arg2
            OP is one of -eq, -ne, -lt, -le, -gt, or -ge.  These arithmetic bi-
            nary  operators return true if arg1 is equal to, not equal to, less
            than, less than or equal to, greater than, or greater than or equal
            to arg2, respectively.  arg1 and arg2 may be positive  or  negative
            integers.   When used with the [[ command, arg1 and arg2 are evalu-
            ated as arithmetic expressions (see ARITHMETIC  EVALUATION  above).
            Since  the  expansions the [[ command performs on arg1 and arg2 can
            potentially result in empty strings, arithmetic expression  evalua-
            tion treats those as expressions that evaluate to 0.

SIMPLE COMMAND EXPANSION
     When the shell executes a simple command, it performs the following expan-
     sions, assignments, and redirections, from left to right, in the following
     order.

     1.     The words that the parser has marked as variable assignments (those
            preceding  the  command  name) and redirections are saved for later
            processing.

     2.     The words that are not variable assignments or redirections are ex-
            panded.  If any words remain after expansion,  the  first  word  is
            taken to be the name of the command and the remaining words are the
            arguments.

     3.     Redirections are performed as described above under REDIRECTION.

     4.     The  text  after  the = in each variable assignment undergoes tilde
            expansion, parameter expansion,  command  substitution,  arithmetic
            expansion, and quote removal before being assigned to the variable.

     If  no  command  name results, the variable assignments affect the current
     shell environment.  In the case of such a command (one that consists  only
     of assignment statements and redirections), assignment statements are per-
     formed before redirections.  Otherwise, the variables are added to the en-
     vironment  of the executed command and do not affect the current shell en-
     vironment.  If any of the assignments attempts to  assign  a  value  to  a
     readonly  variable, an error occurs, and the command exits with a non-zero
     status.

     If no command name results, redirections are performed, but do not  affect
     the  current shell environment.  A redirection error causes the command to
     exit with a non-zero status.

     If there is a command name left after expansion, execution proceeds as de-
     scribed below.  Otherwise, the command exits.  If one  of  the  expansions
     contained  a  command  substitution, the exit status of the command is the
     exit status of the last command substitution performed.  If there were  no
     command substitutions, the command exits with a zero status.

COMMAND EXECUTION
     After  a command has been split into words, if it results in a simple com-
     mand and an optional list of arguments, the shell performs  the  following
     actions.

     If  the command name contains no slashes, the shell attempts to locate it.
     If there exists a shell function by that name, that function is invoked as
     described above in FUNCTIONS.  If the name does not match a function,  the
     shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins.  If a match is found,
     that builtin is invoked.

     If  the  name  is  neither a shell function nor a builtin, and contains no
     slashes, bash searches each element of the PATH for a directory containing
     an executable file by that name.  Bash uses a hash table to  remember  the
     full  pathnames of executable files (see hash under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
     below).  Bash performs a full search of the directories in  PATH  only  if
     the  command  is not found in the hash table.  If the search is unsuccess-
     ful,  the  shell  searches  for  a  defined  shell  function  named   com-
     mand_not_found_handle.   If that function exists, it is invoked in a sepa-
     rate execution environment with the original command and the original com-
     mand's arguments as its arguments, and the function's exit status  becomes
     the  exit  status  of that subshell.  If that function is not defined, the
     shell prints an error message and returns an exit status of 127.

     If the search is successful, or if the command name contains one  or  more
     slashes,  the shell executes the named program in a separate execution en-
     vironment.  Argument 0 is set to the name given, and the  remaining  argu-
     ments to the command are set to the arguments given, if any.

     If  this execution fails because the file is not in executable format, and
     the file is not a directory, it is assumed to be a shell  script,  a  file
     containing  shell commands, and the shell creates a new instance of itself
     to execute it.  Bash tries to determine whether the file is a text file or
     a binary, and will not execute files it determines to be  binaries.   This
     subshell reinitializes itself, so that the effect is as if a new shell had
     been  invoked  to handle the script, with the exception that the locations
     of commands remembered by the parent (see hash below under  SHELL  BUILTIN
     COMMANDS are retained by the child.

     If  the  program  is  a file beginning with #!, the remainder of the first
     line specifies an interpreter for the program.   The  shell  executes  the
     specified  interpreter  on  operating systems that do not handle this exe-
     cutable format themselves.  The arguments to the interpreter consist of  a
     single  optional argument following the interpreter name on the first line
     of the program, followed by the name of the program, followed by the  com-
     mand arguments, if any.

COMMAND EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT
     The shell has an execution environment, which consists of the following:

     *      Open  files  inherited  by  the shell at invocation, as modified by
            redirections supplied to the exec builtin.

     *      The current working directory as set by cd, pushd, or popd, or  in-
            herited by the shell at invocation.

     *      The  file  creation mode mask as set by umask or inherited from the
            shell's parent.

     *      Current traps set by trap.

     *      Shell parameters that are set by variable assignment or with set or
            inherited from the shell's parent in the environment.

     *      Shell functions defined during  execution  or  inherited  from  the
            shell's parent in the environment.

     *      Options  enabled  at invocation (either by default or with command-
            line arguments) or by set.

     *      Options enabled by shopt.

     *      Shell aliases defined with alias.

     *      Various process IDs, including those of background jobs, the  value
            of $$, and the value of PPID.

     When a simple command other than a builtin or shell function is to be exe-
     cuted,  it is invoked in a separate execution environment that consists of
     the following.  Unless otherwise noted, the values are inherited from  the
     shell.

     *      The shell's open files, plus any modifications and additions speci-
            fied by redirections to the command.

     *      The current working directory.

     *      The file creation mode mask.

     *      Shell  variables  and functions marked for export, along with vari-
            ables exported for the command, passed in the environment.

     *      Traps caught by the shell are reset to the  values  inherited  from
            the shell's parent, and traps ignored by the shell are ignored.

     A  command  invoked in this separate environment cannot affect the shell's
     execution environment.

     A subshell is a copy of the shell process.

     Command substitution, commands grouped with parentheses, and  asynchronous
     commands  are invoked in a subshell environment that is a duplicate of the
     shell environment, except that traps caught by the shell are reset to  the
     values  that  the  shell inherited from its parent at invocation.  Builtin
     commands that are invoked as part of a pipeline, except  possibly  in  the
     last element depending on the value of the lastpipe shell option, are also
     executed in a subshell environment.  Changes made to the subshell environ-
     ment cannot affect the shell's execution environment.

     When the shell is in posix mode, subshells spawned to execute command sub-
     stitutions  inherit  the  value  of the -e option from their parent shell.
     When not in posix mode, bash clears the -e option in such subshells.   See
     the  description of the inherit_errexit shell option below for how to con-
     trol this behavior when not in posix mode.

     If a command is followed by a & and job control is not active, the default
     standard input for the command is the empty  file  /dev/null.   Otherwise,
     the  invoked command inherits the file descriptors of the calling shell as
     modified by redirections.

ENVIRONMENT
     When a program is invoked it is given an array of strings called the envi-
     ronment.  This is a list of name-value pairs, of the form name=value.

     The shell provides several ways to manipulate the environment.  On invoca-
     tion, the shell scans its own environment and creates a parameter for each
     name found, automatically marking it for export to child processes.   Exe-
     cuted commands inherit the environment.  The export, declare -x, and unset
     commands  modify  the  environment  by  adding and deleting parameters and
     functions.  If the value of a parameter in the  environment  is  modified,
     the new value automatically becomes part of the environment, replacing the
     old.   The  environment  inherited by any executed command consists of the
     shell's initial environment, whose values may be modified  in  the  shell,
     less  any pairs removed by the unset or export -n commands, plus any addi-
     tions via the export and declare -x commands.

     If any parameter assignments, as described above in PARAMETERS, appear be-
     fore a simple command, the variable assignments are part of that command's
     environment for as long as it executes.  These assignment  statements  af-
     fect only the environment seen by that command.  If these assignments pre-
     cede  a  call to a shell function, the variables are local to the function
     and exported to that function's children.

     If the -k option is set (see the set builtin command below), then all  pa-
     rameter  assignments are placed in the environment for a command, not just
     those that precede the command name.

     When bash invokes an external command, the variable _ is set to  the  full
     pathname of the command and passed to that command in its environment.

EXIT STATUS
     The  exit status of an executed command is the value returned by the wait-
     pid system call or equivalent function.  Exit statuses fall between 0  and
     255,  though,  as explained below, the shell may use values above 125 spe-
     cially.  Exit statuses from shell builtins and compound commands are  also
     limited  to  this  range.  Under certain circumstances, the shell will use
     special values to indicate specific failure modes.

     For the shell's purposes, a command which exits with a  zero  exit  status
     has  succeeded.  So while an exit status of zero indicates success, a non-
     zero exit status indicates failure.

     When a command terminates on a fatal signal N,  bash  uses  the  value  of
     128+N as the exit status.

     If a command is not found, the child process created to execute it returns
     a  status of 127.  If a command is found but is not executable, the return
     status is 126.

     If a command fails because of an error during  expansion  or  redirection,
     the exit status is greater than zero.

     Shell builtin commands return a status of 0 (true) if successful, and non-
     zero  (false)  if an error occurs while they execute.  All builtins return
     an exit status of 2 to indicate incorrect usage, generally invalid options
     or missing arguments.

     The exit status of the last command is available in the special  parameter
     $?.

     Bash itself returns the exit status of the last command executed, unless a
     syntax  error  occurs,  in which case it exits with a non-zero value.  See
     also the exit builtin command below.

SIGNALS
     When bash is interactive, in the absence of any traps, it ignores  SIGTERM
     (so  that kill 0 does not kill an interactive shell), and catches and han-
     dles SIGINT (so that the wait builtin is interruptible).   When  bash  re-
     ceives  SIGINT,  it breaks out of any executing loops.  In all cases, bash
     ignores SIGQUIT.  If job control is in effect, bash ignores SIGTTIN, SIGT-
     TOU, and SIGTSTP.

     The trap builtin modifies the shell's signal handling, as described below.

     Non-builtin commands bash executes have signal handlers set to the  values
     inherited  by  the  shell from its parent, unless trap sets them to be ig-
     nored, in which case the child process will ignore them as well.  When job
     control is not in effect, asynchronous commands ignore SIGINT and  SIGQUIT
     in addition to these inherited handlers.  Commands run as a result of com-
     mand  substitution ignore the keyboard-generated job control signals SIGT-
     TIN, SIGTTOU, and SIGTSTP.

     The shell exits by default upon receipt of a SIGHUP.  Before  exiting,  an
     interactive shell resends the SIGHUP to all jobs, running or stopped.  The
     shell sends SIGCONT to stopped jobs to ensure that they receive the SIGHUP
     (see  JOB  CONTROL  below  for  more information about running and stopped
     jobs).  To prevent the shell from sending the signal to a particular  job,
     remove  it  from the jobs table with the disown builtin (see SHELL BUILTIN
     COMMANDS below) or mark it not to receive SIGHUP using disown -h.

     If the huponexit shell option has been  set  using  shopt,  bash  sends  a
     SIGHUP to all jobs when an interactive login shell exits.

     If  bash  is  waiting  for a command to complete and receives a signal for
     which a trap has been set, it will not execute the trap until the  command
     completes.   If  bash  is waiting for an asynchronous command via the wait
     builtin, and it receives a signal for which a trap has been set, the  wait
     builtin  will return immediately with an exit status greater than 128, im-
     mediately after which the shell executes the trap.

     When job control is not enabled, and bash is waiting for a foreground com-
     mand to complete, the shell receives keyboard-generated  signals  such  as
     SIGINT  (usually  generated  by  ^C) that users commonly intend to send to
     that command.  This happens because the shell and the command are  in  the
     same  process  group as the terminal, and ^C sends SIGINT to all processes
     in that process group.  Since bash does not enable job control by  default
     when the shell is not interactive, this scenario is most common in non-in-
     teractive shells.

     When  job control is enabled, and bash is waiting for a foreground command
     to complete, the shell does not receive  keyboard-generated  signals,  be-
     cause  it is not in the same process group as the terminal.  This scenario
     is most common in interactive shells, where bash attempts  to  enable  job
     control  by  default.   See  JOB  CONTROL below for more information about
     process groups.

     When job control is not enabled, and bash receives  SIGINT  while  waiting
     for  a  foreground  command, it waits until that foreground command termi-
     nates and then decides what to do about the SIGINT:

     1.     If the command terminates due to the SIGINT,  bash  concludes  that
            the user meant to send the SIGINT to the shell as well, and acts on
            the  SIGINT (e.g., by running a SIGINT trap, exiting a non-interac-
            tive shell, or returning to the top level to read a new command).

     2.     If the command does not terminate due to SIGINT, the  program  han-
            dled  the SIGINT itself and did not treat it as a fatal signal.  In
            that case, bash does not treat SIGINT as a  fatal  signal,  either,
            instead  assuming that the SIGINT was used as part of the program's
            normal operation (e.g., emacs uses it to abort editing commands) or
            deliberately discarded.  However, bash will run  any  trap  set  on
            SIGINT,  as it does with any other trapped signal it receives while
            it is waiting for the foreground command to complete, for  compati-
            bility.

     When job control is enabled, bash does not receive keyboard-generated sig-
     nals  such as SIGINT while it is waiting for a foreground command.  An in-
     teractive shell does not pay attention to the SIGINT, even  if  the  fore-
     ground  command terminates as a result, other than noting its exit status.
     If the shell is not interactive, and the foreground command terminates due
     to the SIGINT, bash pretends it received the  SIGINT  itself  (scenario  1
     above), for compatibility.

JOB CONTROL
     Job control refers to the ability to selectively stop (suspend) the execu-
     tion  of processes and continue (resume) their execution at a later point.
     A user typically employs this facility via an interactive  interface  sup-
     plied jointly by the operating system kernel's terminal driver and bash.

     The  shell  associates a job with each pipeline.  It keeps a table of cur-
     rently executing jobs, which the jobs command will display.  Each job  has
     a  job number, which jobs displays between brackets.  Job numbers start at
     1.  When bash starts a job asynchronously (in the background), it prints a
     line that looks like:

            [1] 25647

     indicating that this job is job number 1 and that the process  ID  of  the
     last  process  in  the pipeline associated with this job is 25647.  All of
     the processes in a single pipeline are members of the same job.  Bash uses
     the job abstraction as the basis for job control.

     To facilitate the implementation of the user  interface  to  job  control,
     each  process  has  a process group ID, and the operating system maintains
     the notion of a current terminal process group ID.  This terminal  process
     group ID is associated with the controlling terminal.

     Processes  that  have the same process group ID are said to be part of the
     same process group.  Members of the foreground  process  group  (processes
     whose  process group ID is equal to the current terminal process group ID)
     receive keyboard-generated signals such as SIGINT.  Processes in the fore-
     ground process group are said  to  be  foreground  processes.   Background
     processes  are  those  whose process group ID differs from the controlling
     terminal's; such processes are immune to keyboard-generated signals.  Only
     foreground processes are allowed to read from or, if the user so specifies
     with "stty tostop", write to the controlling terminal.  The system sends a
     SIGTTIN (SIGTTOU) signal to background processes  which  attempt  to  read
     from  (write  to  when  "tostop" is in effect) the terminal, which, unless
     caught, suspends the process.

     If the operating system on which bash is  running  supports  job  control,
     bash  contains  facilities to use it.  Typing the suspend character (typi-
     cally ^Z, Control-Z) while a process is running stops that process and re-
     turns control to bash.  Typing the delayed  suspend  character  (typically
     ^Y, Control-Y) causes the process stop when it attempts to read input from
     the  terminal, and returns control to bash.  The user then manipulates the
     state of this job, using the bg command to continue it in the  background,
     the  fg  command  to continue it in the foreground, or the kill command to
     kill it.  The suspend character takes effect immediately, and has the  ad-
     ditional  side  effect of discarding any pending output and typeahead.  To
     force a background process to stop, or stop a process that's  not  associ-
     ated  with  the current terminal session, send it the SIGSTOP signal using
     kill.

     There are a number of ways to refer to a job in the shell.  The %  charac-
     ter introduces a job specification (jobspec).

     Job  number n may be referred to as %n.  A job may also be referred to us-
     ing a prefix of the name used to start it, or using a substring  that  ap-
     pears in its command line.  For example, %ce refers to a job whose command
     name  begins  with  ce.   Using %?ce, on the other hand, refers to any job
     containing the string ce in its command line.  If the prefix or  substring
     matches more than one job, bash reports an error.

     The  symbols  %% and %+ refer to the shell's notion of the current job.  A
     single % (with no accompanying job specification) also refers to the  cur-
     rent  job.  %- refers to the previous job.  When a job starts in the back-
     ground, a job stops while in the foreground, or a job is  resumed  in  the
     background,  it becomes the current job.  The job that was the current job
     becomes the previous job.  When the current job terminates,  the  previous
     job becomes the current job.  If there is only a single job, %+ and %- can
     both  be  used  to refer to that job.  In output pertaining to jobs (e.g.,
     the output of the jobs command), the current job is always marked  with  a
     +, and the previous job with a -.

     Simply  naming  a job can be used to bring it into the foreground: %1 is a
     synonym for "fg %1", bringing job 1 from the  background  into  the  fore-
     ground.   Similarly, "%1 &" resumes job 1 in the background, equivalent to
     "bg %1".

     The shell learns immediately whenever a job changes state.  Normally, bash
     waits until it is about to print a prompt before notifying the user  about
     changes  in a job's status so as to not interrupt any other output, though
     it will notify of changes in a job's status after a foreground command  in
     a  list  completes, before executing the next command in the list.  If the
     -b option to the set builtin  command  is  enabled,  bash  reports  status
     changes  immediately.   Bash  executes  any trap on SIGCHLD for each child
     that terminates.

     When a job terminates and bash notifies the user about  it,  bash  removes
     the  job from the table.  It will not appear in jobs output, but wait will
     report its exit status, as long as it's supplied the process ID associated
     with the job as an argument.  When the table is empty, job  numbers  start
     over at 1.

     If  a user attempts to exit bash while jobs are stopped (or, if the check-
     jobs shell option has been enabled using the shopt builtin, running),  the
     shell  prints  a warning message, and, if the checkjobs option is enabled,
     lists the jobs and their statuses.  The jobs command may then be  used  to
     inspect  their  status.   If  the user immediately attempts to exit again,
     without an intervening command, bash does not print another  warning,  and
     terminates any stopped jobs.

     When the shell is waiting for a job or process using the wait builtin, and
     job  control is enabled, wait will return when the job changes state.  The
     -f option causes wait to wait until the job or process  terminates  before
     returning.

PROMPTING
     When executing interactively, bash displays the primary prompt PS1 when it
     is  ready  to  read  a command, and the secondary prompt PS2 when it needs
     more input to complete a command.

     Bash examines the value of the array variable PROMPT_COMMAND  just  before
     printing  each  primary prompt.  If any elements in PROMPT_COMMAND are set
     and non-null, Bash executes each value, in numeric order, just  as  if  it
     had  been  typed  on the command line.  Bash displays PS0 after it reads a
     command but before executing it.

     Bash displays PS4 as described above before tracing each command when  the
     -x option is enabled.

     Bash allows the prompt strings PS0, PS1, PS2, and PS4, to be customized by
     inserting  a  number  of backslash-escaped special characters that are de-
     coded as follows:

            \a     An ASCII bell character (07).
            \d     The date in "Weekday Month  Date"  format  (e.g.,  "Tue  May
                   26").
            \D{format}
                   The  format  is  passed to strftime(3) and the result is in-
                   serted into the prompt string; an empty format results in  a
                   locale-specific  time  representation.   The  braces are re-
                   quired.
            \e     An ASCII escape character (033).
            \h     The hostname up to the first ".".
            \H     The hostname.
            \j     The number of jobs currently managed by the shell.
            \l     The basename of the  shell's  terminal  device  name  (e.g.,
                   "ttys0").
            \n     A newline.
            \r     A carriage return.
            \s     The  name of the shell: the basename of $0 (the portion fol-
                   lowing the final slash).
            \t     The current time in 24-hour HH:MM:SS format.
            \T     The current time in 12-hour HH:MM:SS format.
            \@     The current time in 12-hour am/pm format.
            \A     The current time in 24-hour HH:MM format.
            \u     The username of the current user.
            \v     The bash version (e.g., 2.00).
            \V     The bash release, version + patch level (e.g., 2.00.0)
            \w     The value of the PWD shell variable ($PWD), with  $HOME  ab-
                   breviated with a tilde (uses the value of the PROMPT_DIRTRIM
                   variable).
            \W     The basename of $PWD, with $HOME abbreviated with a tilde.
            \!     The history number of this command.
            \#     The command number of this command.
            \$     If the effective UID is 0, a #, otherwise a $.
            \nnn   The character corresponding to the octal number nnn.
            \\     A backslash.
            \[     Begin  a sequence of non-printing characters, which could be
                   used to embed a terminal control sequence into the prompt.
            \]     End a sequence of non-printing characters.

     The command number and the history number are usually different: the  his-
     tory  number  of  a command is its position in the history list, which may
     include commands restored from the history file (see HISTORY below), while
     the command number is the position in the sequence  of  commands  executed
     during  the current shell session.  After the string is decoded, it is ex-
     panded via parameter expansion, command  substitution,  arithmetic  expan-
     sion,  and quote removal, subject to the value of the promptvars shell op-
     tion (see the description of the shopt command under  SHELL  BUILTIN  COM-
     MANDS  below).  This can have unwanted side effects if escaped portions of
     the string appear within command substitution or contain  characters  spe-
     cial to word expansion.

READLINE
     This  is  the library that handles reading input when using an interactive
     shell, unless the --noediting option  is  supplied  at  shell  invocation.
     Line  editing  is  also used when using the -e option to the read builtin.
     By default, the line editing commands are similar to those of emacs; a vi-
     style line editing interface is also available.  Line editing can  be  en-
     abled  at  any time using the -o emacs or -o vi options to the set builtin
     (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  To turn off line  editing  after  the
     shell is running, use the +o emacs or +o vi options to the set builtin.

   Readline Notation
     This  section  uses Emacs-style editing concepts and uses its notation for
     keystrokes.  Control keys are denoted by C-key, e.g., C-n means Control-N.
     Similarly, meta keys are denoted by M-key, so M-x means Meta-X.  The  Meta
     key is often labeled "Alt" or "Option".

     On  keyboards without a Meta key, M-x means ESC x, i.e., press and release
     the Escape key, then press and release the x key, in sequence.  This makes
     ESC the meta prefix.  The combination M-C-x means ESC Control-x: press and
     release the Escape key, then press and hold the Control key while pressing
     the x key, then release both.

     On some keyboards, the Meta key  modifier  produces  characters  with  the
     eighth  bit  (0200) set.  You can use the enable-meta-key variable to con-
     trol whether or not it does this, if the keyboard allows it.  On many oth-
     ers, the terminal or terminal emulator converts the metafied key to a  key
     sequence beginning with ESC as described in the preceding paragraph.

     If your Meta key produces a key sequence with the ESC meta prefix, you can
     make  M-key  key bindings you specify (see Readline Key Bindings below) do
     the same thing by setting the force-meta-prefix variable.

     Readline commands may be given numeric arguments, which normally act as  a
     repeat  count.  Sometimes, however, it is the sign of the argument that is
     significant.  Passing a negative argument to a command that  acts  in  the
     forward  direction  (e.g., kill-line) makes that command act in a backward
     direction.  Commands whose behavior with arguments deviates from this  are
     noted below.

     The  point is the current cursor position, and mark refers to a saved cur-
     sor position.  The text between the point and mark is referred to  as  the
     region.   Readline has the concept of an active region: when the region is
     active, readline redisplay highlights the region using the  value  of  the
     active-region-start-color  variable.   The  enable-active-region  variable
     turns this on and off.  Several commands set the region to  active;  those
     are noted below.

     When a command is described as killing text, the text deleted is saved for
     possible  future  retrieval (yanking).  The killed text is saved in a kill
     ring.  Consecutive kills accumulate the deleted text into one unit,  which
     can  be  yanked all at once.  Commands which do not kill text separate the
     chunks of text on the kill ring.

   Readline Initialization
     Readline is customized by putting commands in an initialization file  (the
     inputrc  file).   The  name  of  this  file is taken from the value of the
     INPUTRC shell variable.   If  that  variable  is  unset,  the  default  is
     ~/.inputrc.   If  that  file   does  not exist or cannot be read, readline
     looks for /etc/inputrc.  When a program that  uses  the  readline  library
     starts  up,  readline reads the initialization file and sets the key bind-
     ings and variables found there, before reading any user input.

     There are only a few basic constructs allowed in the inputrc file.   Blank
     lines  are  ignored.  Lines beginning with a # are comments.  Lines begin-
     ning with a $ indicate conditional constructs.   Other  lines  denote  key
     bindings and variable settings.

     The  default key-bindings in this section may be changed using key binding
     commands in the inputrc file.  Programs that use the readline library, in-
     cluding bash, may add their own commands and bindings.

     For example, placing

            M-Control-u: universal-argument
     or
            C-Meta-u: universal-argument

     into the inputrc would make M-C-u execute  the  readline  command  univer-
     sal-argument.

     Key bindings may contain the following symbolic character names: DEL, ESC,
     ESCAPE,  LFD,  NEWLINE,  RET,  RETURN,  RUBOUT  (a destructive backspace),
     SPACE, SPC, and TAB.

     In addition to command names, readline allows keys to be bound to a string
     that is inserted when the key is pressed (a macro).   The  difference  be-
     tween  a macro and a command is that a macro is enclosed in single or dou-
     ble quotes.

   Readline Key Bindings
     The syntax for controlling key bindings in the  inputrc  file  is  simple.
     All that is required is the name of the command or the text of a macro and
     a key sequence to which it should be bound.  The key sequence may be spec-
     ified  in  one of two ways: as a symbolic key name, possibly with Meta- or
     Control- prefixes, or as a key sequence composed of one or more characters
     enclosed in double quotes.  The key sequence and name are separated  by  a
     colon.  There can be no whitespace between the name and the colon.

     When using the form keyname:function-name or macro, keyname is the name of
     a key spelled out in English.  For example:

            Control-u: universal-argument
            Meta-Rubout: backward-kill-word
            Control-o: "> output"

     In  the  above  example,  C-u is bound to the function universal-argument,
     M-DEL is bound to the function backward-kill-word, and C-o is bound to run
     the macro expressed on the right hand side (that is, to insert the text ">
     output" into the line).

     In the second form, "keyseq":function-name or macro, keyseq  differs  from
     keyname above in that strings denoting an entire key sequence may be spec-
     ified  by placing the sequence within double quotes.  Some GNU Emacs style
     key escapes can be used, as in the following example, but none of the sym-
     bolic character names are recognized.

            "\C-u": universal-argument
            "\C-x\C-r": re-read-init-file
            "\e[11~": "Function Key 1"

     In this example, C-u is again bound to  the  function  universal-argument.
     C-x  C-r  is  bound  to the function re-read-init-file, and ESC [ 1 1 ~ is
     bound to insert the text "Function Key 1".

     The full set of GNU Emacs style escape sequences available when specifying
     key sequences is
            \C-    A control prefix.
            \M-    Adding the meta prefix or converting the following character
                   to a meta character, as described  below  under  force-meta-
                   prefix.
            \e     An escape character.
            \\     Backslash.
            \"     Literal ", a double quote.
            \'     Literal ', a single quote.

     In addition to the GNU Emacs style escape sequences, a second set of back-
     slash escapes is available:
            \a     alert (bell)
            \b     backspace
            \d     delete
            \f     form feed
            \n     newline
            \r     carriage return
            \t     horizontal tab
            \v     vertical tab
            \nnn   The  eight-bit  character whose value is the octal value nnn
                   (one to three digits).
            \xHH   The eight-bit character whose value is the hexadecimal value
                   HH (one or two hex digits).

     When entering the text of a macro, single or double quotes must be used to
     indicate a macro definition.  Unquoted text is assumed to  be  a  function
     name.   The  backslash  escapes  described above are expanded in the macro
     body.  Backslash quotes any other character in the macro text, including "
     and '.

     Bash will display or modify the current readline  key  bindings  with  the
     bind  builtin  command.   The -o emacs or -o vi options to the set builtin
     (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below) change the editing mode during interac-
     tive use.

   Readline Variables
     Readline has variables that can be used to further customize its behavior.
     A variable may be set in the inputrc file with a statement of the form

            set variable-name value
     or using the bind builtin command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).

     Except where noted, readline variables can  take  the  values  On  or  Off
     (without  regard to case).  Unrecognized variable names are ignored.  When
     readline reads a variable value, empty or null values, "on" (case-insensi-
     tive), and "1" are equivalent to On.  All other values are  equivalent  to
     Off.

     The  bind  -V command lists the current readline variable names and values
     (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).

     The variables and their default values are:

     active-region-start-color
            A string variable that controls the text color and background  when
            displaying  the  text  in the active region (see the description of
            enable-active-region below).  This string  must  not  take  up  any
            physical  character  positions on the display, so it should consist
            only of terminal escape sequences.  It is output  to  the  terminal
            before  displaying the text in the active region.  This variable is
            reset to the default value whenever the terminal type changes.  The
            default value is the string that  puts  the  terminal  in  standout
            mode, as obtained from the terminal's terminfo description.  A sam-
            ple value might be "\e[01;33m".
     active-region-end-color
            A   string   variable  that  "undoes"  the  effects  of  active-re-
            gion-start-color and restores "normal" terminal display  appearance
            after  displaying  text in the active region.  This string must not
            take up any physical character positions  on  the  display,  so  it
            should  consist only of terminal escape sequences.  It is output to
            the terminal after displaying the text in the active region.   This
            variable  is  reset to the default value whenever the terminal type
            changes.  The default value is the string that restores the  termi-
            nal  from  standout  mode, as obtained from the terminal's terminfo
            description.  A sample value might be "\e[0m".
     bell-style (audible)
            Controls what happens when readline  wants  to  ring  the  terminal
            bell.   If  set  to none, readline never rings the bell.  If set to
            visible, readline uses a visible bell if one is available.  If  set
            to audible, readline attempts to ring the terminal's bell.
     bind-tty-special-chars (On)
            If set to On, readline attempts to bind the control characters that
            are  treated  specially  by  the  kernel's terminal driver to their
            readline equivalents.  These override the default readline bindings
            described here.  Type "stty -a" at a bash prompt to see  your  cur-
            rent  terminal  settings,  including the special control characters
            (usually cchars).
     blink-matching-paren (Off)
            If set to On, readline attempts to briefly move the  cursor  to  an
            opening parenthesis when a closing parenthesis is inserted.
     colored-completion-prefix (Off)
            If  set to On, when listing completions, readline displays the com-
            mon prefix of the set of possible  completions  using  a  different
            color.   The  color  definitions  are  taken  from the value of the
            LS_COLORS environment variable.  If there is a color definition  in
            $LS_COLORS for the custom suffix ".readline-colored-completion-pre-
            fix", readline uses this color for the common prefix instead of its
            default.
     colored-stats (Off)
            If  set to On, readline displays possible completions using differ-
            ent colors to indicate their file type.  The color definitions  are
            taken from the value of the LS_COLORS environment variable.
     comment-begin ("#")
            The  string that the readline insert-comment command inserts.  This
            command is bound to M-# in emacs mode and to # in vi command mode.
     completion-display-width (-1)
            The number of screen columns used to display possible matches  when
            performing  completion.   The value is ignored if it is less than 0
            or greater than the terminal screen width.  A  value  of  0  causes
            matches to be displayed one per line.  The default value is -1.
     completion-ignore-case (Off)
            If set to On, readline performs filename matching and completion in
            a case-insensitive fashion.
     completion-map-case (Off)
            If  set  to  On,  and  completion-ignore-case  is enabled, readline
            treats hyphens (-) and underscores (_) as equivalent when  perform-
            ing case-insensitive filename matching and completion.
     completion-prefix-display-length (0)
            The  maximum length in characters of the common prefix of a list of
            possible completions that is displayed without modification.   When
            set to a value greater than zero, readline replaces common prefixes
            longer  than  this  value with an ellipsis when displaying possible
            completions.  If a completion begins with a period, and eadline  is
            completing  filenames,  it uses three underscores instead of an el-
            lipsis.
     completion-query-items (100)
            This determines when the user is queried about viewing  the  number
            of  possible completions generated by the possible-completions com-
            mand.  It may be set to any integer value greater than or equal  to
            zero.   If  the  number  of possible completions is greater than or
            equal to the value of this variable, readline asks whether  or  not
            the  user wishes to view them; otherwise readline simply lists them
            on the terminal.  A zero value means  readline  should  never  ask;
            negative values are treated as zero.
     convert-meta (On)
            If  set  to On, readline converts characters it reads that have the
            eighth bit set to an ASCII key sequence by clearing the eighth  bit
            and prefixing it with an escape character (converting the character
            to  have the meta prefix).  The default is On, but readline sets it
            to Off if the locale contains characters whose  encodings  may  in-
            clude bytes with the eighth bit set.  This variable is dependent on
            the LC_CTYPE locale category, and may change if the locale changes.
            This  variable  also  affects  key bindings; see the description of
            force-meta-prefix below.
     disable-completion (Off)
            If set to On, readline inhibits word completion.  Completion  char-
            acters  are  inserted  into  the line as if they had been mapped to
            self-insert.
     echo-control-characters (On)
            When set to On, on operating systems that indicate they support it,
            readline echoes a character corresponding  to  a  signal  generated
            from the keyboard.
     editing-mode (emacs)
            Controls  whether  readline  uses  a set of key bindings similar to
            Emacs or vi.  editing-mode can be set to either emacs or vi.
     emacs-mode-string (@)
            If the show-mode-in-prompt variable is enabled, this string is dis-
            played immediately before the last line of the primary prompt  when
            emacs  editing  mode  is  active.  The value is expanded like a key
            binding, so the standard set of meta-  and  control-  prefixes  and
            backslash escape sequences is available.  The \1 and \2 escapes be-
            gin and end sequences of non-printing characters, which can be used
            to embed a terminal control sequence into the mode string.
     enable-active-region (On)
            When  this  variable is set to On, readline allows certain commands
            to designate the region as active.   When  the  region  is  active,
            readline  highlights  the text in the region using the value of the
            active-region-start-color variable, which defaults  to  the  string
            that enables the terminal's standout mode.  The active region shows
            the text inserted by bracketed-paste and any matching text found by
            incremental and non-incremental history searches.
     enable-bracketed-paste (On)
            When  set  to  On,  readline configures the terminal to insert each
            paste into the editing buffer as a single string of characters, in-
            stead of treating each character as if it had been  read  from  the
            keyboard.   This  is called bracketed-paste mode; it prevents read-
            line from executing any editing commands bound to key sequences ap-
            pearing in the pasted text.
     enable-keypad (Off)
            When set to On, readline tries  to enable  the  application  keypad
            when  it  is  called.   Some  systems need this to enable the arrow
            keys.
     enable-meta-key (On)
            When set to On, readline tries to enable any meta modifier key  the
            terminal  claims  to  support.   On many terminals, the Meta key is
            used to send eight-bit characters; this  variable  checks  for  the
            terminal capability that indicates the terminal can enable and dis-
            able  a  mode that sets the eighth bit of a character (0200) if the
            Meta key is held down when the character is typed (a  meta  charac-
            ter).
     expand-tilde (Off)
            If  set  to  On, readline performs tilde expansion when it attempts
            word completion.
     force-meta-prefix (Off)
            If set to On, readline modifies its behavior when binding  key  se-
            quences  containing  \M-  or Meta- (see Key Bindings above) by con-
            verting a key sequence of the form \M-C or Meta-C to the  two-char-
            acter  sequence ESC C (adding the meta prefix).  If force-meta-pre-
            fix is set to Off (the default), readline uses  the  value  of  the
            convert-meta  variable to determine whether to perform this conver-
            sion: if convert-meta is On, readline performs the  conversion  de-
            scribed  above; if it is Off, readline converts C to a meta charac-
            ter by setting the eighth bit (0200).
     history-preserve-point (Off)
            If set to On, the history code attempts to place point at the  same
            location  on  each  history line retrieved with previous-history or
            next-history.
     history-size (unset)
            Set the maximum number of history  entries  saved  in  the  history
            list.  If set to zero, any existing history entries are deleted and
            no  new  entries  are saved.  If set to a value less than zero, the
            number of history entries is not limited.  By  default,  bash  sets
            the  maximum number of history entries to the value of the HISTSIZE
            shell variable.  Setting history-size to a non-numeric  value  will
            set the maximum number of history entries to 500.
     horizontal-scroll-mode (Off)
            Setting  this  variable  to On makes readline use a single line for
            display, scrolling the input horizontally on a single  screen  line
            when  it  becomes longer than the screen width rather than wrapping
            to a new line.  This setting is automatically enabled for terminals
            of height 1.
     input-meta (Off)
            If set to On, readline enables eight-bit input (that  is,  it  does
            not clear the eighth bit in the characters it reads), regardless of
            what  the  terminal claims it can support.  The default is Off, but
            readline sets it to On if the locale contains characters whose  en-
            codings  may  include bytes with the eighth bit set.  This variable
            is dependent on the LC_CTYPE locale category,  and  its  value  may
            change  if the locale changes.  The name meta-flag is a synonym for
            input-meta.
     isearch-terminators ("C-[C-j")
            The string of  characters  that  should  terminate  an  incremental
            search  without  subsequently executing the character as a command.
            If this variable has not been given a value, the characters ESC and
            C-j terminate an incremental search.
     keymap (emacs)
            Set the current readline keymap.  The set of valid keymap names  is
            emacs,  emacs-standard, emacs-meta, emacs-ctlx, vi, vi-command, and
            vi-insert.  vi is equivalent to vi-command; emacs is equivalent  to
            emacs-standard.   The  default  value  is emacs; the value of edit-
            ing-mode also affects the default keymap.
     keyseq-timeout (500)
            Specifies the duration readline will  wait  for  a  character  when
            reading an ambiguous key sequence (one that can form a complete key
            sequence  using the input read so far, or can take additional input
            to complete a longer key sequence).  If readline does  not  receive
            any  input within the timeout, it uses the shorter but complete key
            sequence.  The value is specified in milliseconds, so  a  value  of
            1000 means that readline will wait one second for additional input.
            If  this  variable is set to a value less than or equal to zero, or
            to a non-numeric value, readline waits until another key is pressed
            to decide which key sequence to complete.
     mark-directories (On)
            If set to On, completed directory names have a slash appended.
     mark-modified-lines (Off)
            If set to On, readline displays history lines that have been  modi-
            fied with a preceding asterisk (*).
     mark-symlinked-directories (Off)
            If  set to On, completed names which are symbolic links to directo-
            ries have a slash appended, subject to the value  of  mark-directo-
            ries.
     match-hidden-files (On)
            This variable, when set to On, forces readline to match files whose
            names  begin  with  a  "."  (hidden files) when performing filename
            completion.  If set to Off, the user must include the  leading  "."
            in the filename to be completed.
     menu-complete-display-prefix (Off)
            If  set  to  On,  menu completion displays the common prefix of the
            list of possible completions (which may be  empty)  before  cycling
            through the list.
     output-meta (Off)
            If  set to On, readline displays characters with the eighth bit set
            directly rather than as a meta-prefixed escape sequence.   The  de-
            fault  is  Off,  but  readline sets it to On if the locale contains
            characters whose encodings may include bytes with  the  eighth  bit
            set.   This  variable is dependent on the LC_CTYPE locale category,
            and its value may change if the locale changes.
     page-completions (On)
            If set to On, readline uses an internal pager resembling more(1) to
            display a screenful of possible completions at a time.
     prefer-visible-bell
            See bell-style.
     print-completions-horizontally (Off)
            If set to On, readline displays  completions  with  matches  sorted
            horizontally in alphabetical order, rather than down the screen.
     revert-all-at-newline (Off)
            If  set  to On, readline will undo all changes to history lines be-
            fore returning when executing  accept-line.   By  default,  history
            lines may be modified and retain individual undo lists across calls
            to readline.
     search-ignore-case (Off)
            If  set  to  On,  readline performs incremental and non-incremental
            history list searches in a case-insensitive fashion.
     show-all-if-ambiguous (Off)
            This alters the default behavior of the completion  functions.   If
            set to On, words which have more than one possible completion cause
            the matches to be listed immediately instead of ringing the bell.
     show-all-if-unmodified (Off)
            This  alters  the default behavior of the completion functions in a
            fashion similar to show-all-if-ambiguous.   If  set  to  On,  words
            which  have  more than one possible completion without any possible
            partial completion (the possible completions don't share  a  common
            prefix) cause the matches to be listed immediately instead of ring-
            ing the bell.
     show-mode-in-prompt (Off)
            If  set to On, add a string to the beginning of the prompt indicat-
            ing the editing mode: emacs, vi command, or vi insertion.  The mode
            strings are user-settable (e.g., emacs-mode-string).
     skip-completed-text (Off)
            If set to On, this alters the default completion behavior when  in-
            serting  a  single match into the line.  It's only active when per-
            forming completion in the middle of a word.  If  enabled,  readline
            does  not  insert characters from the completion that match charac-
            ters after point in the word being completed, so  portions  of  the
            word following the cursor are not duplicated.
     vi-cmd-mode-string ((cmd))
            If the show-mode-in-prompt variable is enabled, this string is dis-
            played  immediately before the last line of the primary prompt when
            vi editing mode is active and in command mode.  The  value  is  ex-
            panded  like  a  key binding, so the standard set of meta- and con-
            trol- prefixes and backslash escape sequences is available.  The \1
            and \2 escapes begin and end sequences of non-printing  characters,
            which  can  be  used  to embed a terminal control sequence into the
            mode string.
     vi-ins-mode-string ((ins))
            If the show-mode-in-prompt variable is enabled, this string is dis-
            played immediately before the last line of the primary prompt  when
            vi  editing mode is active and in insertion mode.  The value is ex-
            panded like a key binding, so the standard set of  meta-  and  con-
            trol- prefixes and backslash escape sequences is available.  The \1
            and  \2 escapes begin and end sequences of non-printing characters,
            which can be used to embed a terminal  control  sequence  into  the
            mode string.
     visible-stats (Off)
            If  set  to  On,  a character denoting a file's type as reported by
            stat(2) is appended to the filename when listing  possible  comple-
            tions.

   Readline Conditional Constructs
     Readline implements a facility similar in spirit to the conditional compi-
     lation  features of the C preprocessor which allows key bindings and vari-
     able settings to be performed as the result  of  tests.   There  are  four
     parser directives available.

     $if    The  $if  construct allows bindings to be made based on the editing
            mode, the terminal being used, or the application  using  readline.
            The text of the test, after any comparison operator, extends to the
            end of the line; unless otherwise noted, no characters are required
            to isolate it.

            mode   The  mode= form of the $if directive is used to test whether
                   readline is in emacs or vi mode.  This may be used  in  con-
                   junction  with  the set keymap command, for instance, to set
                   bindings in the emacs-standard and emacs-ctlx  keymaps  only
                   if readline is starting out in emacs mode.

            term   The  term= form may be used to include terminal-specific key
                   bindings, perhaps to bind the key sequences  output  by  the
                   terminal's function keys.  The word on the right side of the
                   =  is  tested against both the full name of the terminal and
                   the portion of the terminal name before the first  -.   This
                   allows xterm to match both xterm and xterm-256color, for in-
                   stance.

            version
                   The  version test may be used to perform comparisons against
                   specific readline versions.  The version expands to the cur-
                   rent readline version.  The set of comparison operators  in-
                   cludes  =, (and ==), !=, <=, >=, <, and >.  The version num-
                   ber supplied on the right side of the operator consists of a
                   major version number, an optional decimal point, and an  op-
                   tional  minor  version (e.g., 7.1).  If the minor version is
                   omitted, it defaults to 0.  The operator  may  be  separated
                   from the string version and from the version number argument
                   by whitespace.

            application
                   The  application  construct  is used to include application-
                   specific settings.  Each program using the readline  library
                   sets  the  application  name, and an initialization file can
                   test for a particular value.  This could be used to bind key
                   sequences to functions useful for a specific  program.   For
                   instance,  the  following  command  adds a key sequence that
                   quotes the current or previous word in bash:

                   $if Bash
                   # Quote the current or previous word
                   "\C-xq": "\eb\"\ef\""
                   $endif

            variable
                   The variable construct provides simple  equality  tests  for
                   readline variables and values.  The permitted comparison op-
                   erators  are =, ==, and !=.  The variable name must be sepa-
                   rated from the comparison operator by whitespace; the opera-
                   tor may be separated from the value on the right  hand  side
                   by  whitespace.  String and boolean variables may be tested.
                   Boolean variables must be tested against the values  on  and
                   off.

     $else  Commands  in  this  branch of the $if directive are executed if the
            test fails.

     $endif
            This command, as seen in the previous example,  terminates  an  $if
            command.

     $include
            This  directive  takes  a  single filename as an argument and reads
            commands and key bindings from that file.  For example, the follow-
            ing directive would read /etc/inputrc:

            $include  /etc/inputrc

   Searching
     Readline provides commands for searching through the command history  (see
     HISTORY  below)  for  lines  containing a specified string.  There are two
     search modes: incremental and non-incremental.

     Incremental searches begin before the user has finished typing the  search
     string.   As  each  character of the search string is typed, readline dis-
     plays the next entry from the history matching the string  typed  so  far.
     An  incremental  search requires only as many characters as needed to find
     the desired history entry.  When using emacs editing  mode,  type  C-r  to
     search  backward  in  the  history  for  a  particular string.  Typing C-s
     searches forward through the history.  The characters present in the value
     of the isearch-terminators variable are used to terminate  an  incremental
     search.   If that variable has not been assigned a value, ESC and C-j ter-
     minate an incremental search.  C-g aborts an incremental  search  and  re-
     stores  the original line.  When the search is terminated, the history en-
     try containing the search string becomes the current line.

     To find other matching entries in the history list, type C-r or C-s as ap-
     propriate.  This searches backward or forward in the history for the  next
     entry  matching  the  search  string typed so far.  Any other key sequence
     bound to a readline command terminates the search and executes  that  com-
     mand.  For instance, a newline terminates the search and accepts the line,
     thereby  executing  the command from the history list.  A movement command
     will terminate the search, make the last line found the current line,  and
     begin editing.

     Readline  remembers  the  last incremental search string.  If two C-rs are
     typed without any intervening characters defining  a  new  search  string,
     readline uses any remembered search string.

     Non-incremental  searches read the entire search string before starting to
     search for matching history entries.  The search string may  be  typed  by
     the user or be part of the contents of the current line.

   Readline Command Names
     The  following  is a list of the names of the commands and the default key
     sequences to which they are bound.  Command names without an  accompanying
     key sequence are unbound by default.

     In  the  following  descriptions, point refers to the current cursor posi-
     tion, and mark refers to a cursor position saved by the set-mark  command.
     The  text  between the point and mark is referred to as the region.  Read-
     line has the concept of an active region: when the region is active, read-
     line redisplay highlights the region using the  value  of  the  active-re-
     gion-start-color  variable.   The  enable-active-region  readline variable
     turns this on and off.  Several commands set the region to  active;  those
     are noted below.

   Commands for Moving
     beginning-of-line (C-a)
            Move  to  the start of the current line.  This may also be bound to
            the Home key on some keyboards.
     end-of-line (C-e)
            Move to the end of the line.  This may also be bound to the End key
            on some keyboards.
     forward-char (C-f)
            Move forward a character.  This may also be bound to the right  ar-
            row key on some keyboards.
     backward-char (C-b)
            Move  back  a  character.  This may also be bound to the left arrow
            key on some keyboards.
     forward-word (M-f)
            Move forward to the end of the next word.  Words  are  composed  of
            alphanumeric characters (letters and digits).
     backward-word (M-b)
            Move  back to the start of the current or previous word.  Words are
            composed of alphanumeric characters (letters and digits).
     shell-forward-word (M-C-f)
            Move forward to the end of the next word.  Words are  delimited  by
            non-quoted shell metacharacters.
     shell-backward-word (M-C-b)
            Move  back to the start of the current or previous word.  Words are
            delimited by non-quoted shell metacharacters.
     previous-screen-line
            Attempt to move point to the same physical  screen  column  on  the
            previous  physical screen line.  This will not have the desired ef-
            fect if the current readline line does not take up  more  than  one
            physical  line  or  if  point is not greater than the length of the
            prompt plus the screen width.
     next-screen-line
            Attempt to move point to the same physical  screen  column  on  the
            next  physical  screen line.  This will not have the desired effect
            if the current readline line does not take up more than one  physi-
            cal  line  or  if  the  length  of the current readline line is not
            greater than the length of the prompt plus the screen width.
     clear-display (M-C-l)
            Clear the  screen  and,  if  possible,  the  terminal's  scrollback
            buffer,  then  redraw the current line, leaving the current line at
            the top of the screen.
     clear-screen (C-l)
            Clear the screen, then redraw the current line, leaving the current
            line at the top of the screen.  With a  numeric  argument,  refresh
            the current line without clearing the screen.
     redraw-current-line
            Refresh the current line.

   Commands for Manipulating the History
     accept-line (Newline, Return)
            Accept the line regardless of where the cursor is.  If this line is
            non-empty, add it to the history list according to the state of the
            HISTCONTROL  and  HISTIGNORE  variables.  If the line is a modified
            history line, restore the history line to its original state.
     previous-history (C-p)
            Fetch the previous command from the history list,  moving  back  in
            the  list.  This may also be bound to the up arrow key on some key-
            boards.
     next-history (C-n)
            Fetch the next command from the history list, moving forward in the
            list.  This may also be bound to the down arrow key  on  some  key-
            boards.
     beginning-of-history (M-<)
            Move to the first line in the history.
     end-of-history (M->)
            Move  to the end of the input history, i.e., the line currently be-
            ing entered.
     operate-and-get-next (C-o)
            Accept the current line for execution as if a newline had been  en-
            tered,  and  fetch  the next line relative to the current line from
            the history for editing.  A numeric argument, if  supplied,  speci-
            fies the history entry to use instead of the current line.
     fetch-history
            With a numeric argument, fetch that entry from the history list and
            make  it  the  current line.  Without an argument, move back to the
            first entry in the history list.
     reverse-search-history (C-r)
            Search backward starting  at  the  current  line  and  moving  "up"
            through  the  history as necessary.  This is an incremental search.
            This command sets the region to the matched text and activates  the
            region.
     forward-search-history (C-s)
            Search  forward  starting  at  the  current  line and moving "down"
            through the history as necessary.  This is an  incremental  search.
            This  command sets the region to the matched text and activates the
            region.
     non-incremental-reverse-search-history (M-p)
            Search backward through the history starting at  the  current  line
            using  a  non-incremental search for a string supplied by the user.
            The search string may match anywhere in a history line.
     non-incremental-forward-search-history (M-n)
            Search forward through the history using a  non-incremental  search
            for  a  string  supplied  by the user.  The search string may match
            anywhere in a history line.
     history-search-backward
            Search backward through the history for the  string  of  characters
            between  the  start  of the current line and the point.  The search
            string must match at the beginning of a history line.   This  is  a
            non-incremental  search.   This  may be bound to the Page Up key on
            some keyboards.
     history-search-forward
            Search forward through the history for the string of characters be-
            tween the start of the current line  and  the  point.   The  search
            string  must  match  at the beginning of a history line.  This is a
            non-incremental search.  This may be bound to the Page Down key  on
            some keyboards.
     history-substring-search-backward
            Search  backward  through  the history for the string of characters
            between the start of the current line and the  point.   The  search
            string  may match anywhere in a history line.  This is a non-incre-
            mental search.
     history-substring-search-forward
            Search forward through the history for the string of characters be-
            tween the start of the current line  and  the  point.   The  search
            string  may match anywhere in a history line.  This is a non-incre-
            mental search.
     yank-nth-arg (M-C-y)
            Insert the first argument to the previous command (usually the sec-
            ond word on the previous line) at point.  With an argument  n,  in-
            sert  the nth word from the previous command (the words in the pre-
            vious command begin with word 0).  A negative argument inserts  the
            nth word from the end of the previous command.  Once the argument n
            is  computed, this uses the history expansion facilities to extract
            the nth word, as if the "!n" history expansion had been specified.
     yank-last-arg (M-., M-_)
            Insert the last argument to the previous command (the last word  of
            the  previous  history entry).  With a numeric argument, behave ex-
            actly like yank-nth-arg.  Successive calls  to  yank-last-arg  move
            back through the history list, inserting the last word (or the word
            specified  by the argument to the first call) of each line in turn.
            Any numeric argument supplied to these successive calls  determines
            the  direction  to  move  through the history.  A negative argument
            switches the direction through the history (back or forward).  This
            uses the history expansion facilities to extract the last word,  as
            if the "!$" history expansion had been specified.
     shell-expand-line (M-C-e)
            Expand the line by performing shell word expansions.  This performs
            alias and history expansion, $'string' and $"string" quoting, tilde
            expansion,  parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion,
            command and process substitution, word  splitting,  and  quote  re-
            moval.  An explicit argument suppresses command and process substi-
            tution.   See  HISTORY EXPANSION below for a description of history
            expansion.
     history-expand-line (M-^)
            Perform history expansion on the current line.  See HISTORY  EXPAN-
            SION below for a description of history expansion.
     magic-space
            Perform  history  expansion on the current line and insert a space.
            See HISTORY EXPANSION below for a description of history expansion.
     alias-expand-line
            Perform alias expansion on the current line.  See ALIASES above for
            a description of alias expansion.
     history-and-alias-expand-line
            Perform history and alias expansion on the current line.
     insert-last-argument (M-., M-_)
            A synonym for yank-last-arg.
     edit-and-execute-command (C-x C-e)
            Invoke an editor on the current command line, and execute  the  re-
            sult  as shell commands.  Bash attempts to invoke $VISUAL, $EDITOR,
            and emacs as the editor, in that order.

   Commands for Changing Text
     end-of-file (usually C-d)
            The character  indicating  end-of-file  as  set,  for  example,  by
            stty(1).  If this character is read when there are no characters on
            the  line,  and point is at the beginning of the line, readline in-
            terprets it as the end of input and returns EOF.
     delete-char (C-d)
            Delete the character at point.  If this function is  bound  to  the
            same  character  as  the tty EOF character, as C-d commonly is, see
            above for the effects.  This may also be bound to the Delete key on
            some keyboards.
     backward-delete-char (Rubout)
            Delete the character behind the cursor.  When given a numeric argu-
            ment, save the deleted text on the kill ring.
     forward-backward-delete-char
            Delete the character under the cursor, unless the cursor is at  the
            end  of  the line, in which case the character behind the cursor is
            deleted.
     quoted-insert (C-q, C-v)
            Add the next character typed to the line verbatim.  This is how  to
            insert characters like C-q, for example.
     tab-insert (C-v TAB)
            Insert a tab character.
     self-insert (a, b, A, 1, !, ...)
            Insert the character typed.
     bracketed-paste-begin
            This  function is intended to be bound to the "bracketed paste" es-
            cape sequence sent by some terminals, and such  a  binding  is  as-
            signed by default.  It allows readline to insert the pasted text as
            a  single  unit  without  treating each character as if it had been
            read from the keyboard.  The pasted characters are inserted  as  if
            each  one was bound to self-insert instead of executing any editing
            commands.
            Bracketed paste sets the region to the inserted text and  activates
            the region.
     transpose-chars (C-t)
            Drag  the  character  before  point  forward  over the character at
            point, moving point forward as well.  If point is at the end of the
            line, then this transposes the two characters before point.   Nega-
            tive arguments have no effect.
     transpose-words (M-t)
            Drag  the word before point past the word after point, moving point
            past that word as well.  If point is at the end of the  line,  this
            transposes the last two words on the line.
     shell-transpose-words (M-C-t)
            Drag  the word before point past the word after point, moving point
            past that word as well.  If the insertion point is at  the  end  of
            the  line,  this  transposes  the last two words on the line.  Word
            boundaries are  the  same  as  shell-forward-word  and  shell-back-
            ward-word.
     upcase-word (M-u)
            Uppercase  the  current (or following) word.  With a negative argu-
            ment, uppercase the previous word, but do not move point.
     downcase-word (M-l)
            Lowercase the current (or following) word.  With a  negative  argu-
            ment, lowercase the previous word, but do not move point.
     capitalize-word (M-c)
            Capitalize  the current (or following) word.  With a negative argu-
            ment, capitalize the previous word, but do not move point.
     overwrite-mode
            Toggle overwrite mode.  With an explicit positive numeric argument,
            switches to overwrite mode.  With an explicit non-positive  numeric
            argument, switches to insert mode.  This command affects only emacs
            mode;  vi mode does overwrite differently.  Each call to readline()
            starts in insert mode.
            In overwrite mode, characters bound to self-insert replace the text
            at point rather than pushing the text  to  the  right.   Characters
            bound  to  backward-delete-char  replace the character before point
            with a space.  By default, this command  is  unbound,  but  may  be
            bound to the Insert key on some keyboards.

   Killing and Yanking
     kill-line (C-k)
            Kill  the  text  from point to the end of the current line.  With a
            negative numeric argument, kill backward from the cursor to the be-
            ginning of the line.
     backward-kill-line (C-x Rubout)
            Kill backward to the beginning of the current line.  With  a  nega-
            tive  numeric  argument, kill forward from the cursor to the end of
            the line.
     unix-line-discard (C-u)
            Kill backward from point to the beginning of the line,  saving  the
            killed text on the kill-ring.
     kill-whole-line
            Kill all characters on the current line, no matter where point is.
     kill-word (M-d)
            Kill  from  point  to  the  end  of the current word, or if between
            words, to the end of the next word.  Word boundaries are  the  same
            as those used by forward-word.
     backward-kill-word (M-Rubout)
            Kill  the word behind point.  Word boundaries are the same as those
            used by backward-word.
     shell-kill-word (M-C-d)
            Kill from point to the end of  the  current  word,  or  if  between
            words,  to  the end of the next word.  Word boundaries are the same
            as those used by shell-forward-word.
     shell-backward-kill-word
            Kill the word behind point.  Word boundaries are the same as  those
            used by shell-backward-word.
     unix-word-rubout (C-w)
            Kill  the  word behind point, using white space as a word boundary,
            saving the killed text on the kill-ring.
     unix-filename-rubout
            Kill the word behind point, using white space and the slash charac-
            ter as the word boundaries, saving the killed  text  on  the  kill-
            ring.
     delete-horizontal-space (M-\)
            Delete all spaces and tabs around point.
     kill-region
            Kill the text in the current region.
     copy-region-as-kill
            Copy the text in the region to the kill buffer, so it can be yanked
            immediately.
     copy-backward-word
            Copy the word before point to the kill buffer.  The word boundaries
            are the same as backward-word.
     copy-forward-word
            Copy  the word following point to the kill buffer.  The word bound-
            aries are the same as forward-word.
     yank (C-y)
            Yank the top of the kill ring into the buffer at point.
     yank-pop (M-y)
            Rotate the kill ring, and yank the new top.  Only  works  following
            yank or yank-pop.

   Numeric Arguments
     digit-argument (M-0, M-1, ..., M--)
            Add this digit to the argument already accumulating, or start a new
            argument.  M-- starts a negative argument.
     universal-argument
            This  is  another  way  to specify an argument.  If this command is
            followed by one or more digits, optionally  with  a  leading  minus
            sign, those digits define the argument.  If the command is followed
            by  digits, executing universal-argument again ends the numeric ar-
            gument, but is otherwise ignored.  As a special case, if this  com-
            mand is immediately followed by a character that is neither a digit
            nor  minus  sign, the argument count for the next command is multi-
            plied by four.  The argument count is initially one,  so  executing
            this  function the first time makes the argument count four, a sec-
            ond time makes the argument count sixteen, and so on.

   Completing
     complete (TAB)
            Attempt to perform completion on the text before point.   Bash  at-
            tempts  completion  by  first checking for any programmable comple-
            tions for the command word  (see  Programmable  Completion  below),
            otherwise  treating the text as a variable (if the text begins with
            $), username (if the text begins with ~), hostname (if the text be-
            gins  with  @),  or  command  (including  aliases,  functions,  and
            builtins)  in  turn.   If  none of these produces a match, it falls
            back to filename completion.
     possible-completions (M-?)
            List the possible completions of the text before point.  When  dis-
            playing  completions,  readline sets the number of columns used for
            display to the value of completion-display-width, the value of  the
            shell variable COLUMNS, or the screen width, in that order.
     insert-completions (M-*)
            Insert  all  completions  of  the text before point that would have
            been generated by possible-completions, separated by a space.
     menu-complete
            Similar to complete, but replaces the word to be completed  with  a
            single match from the list of possible completions.  Repeatedly ex-
            ecuting  menu-complete  steps  through the list of possible comple-
            tions, inserting each match in turn.  At the end  of  the  list  of
            completions,  menu-complete  rings the bell (subject to the setting
            of bell-style) and restores the original text.  An  argument  of  n
            moves  n positions forward in the list of matches; a negative argu-
            ment moves backward through the list.  This command is intended  to
            be bound to TAB, but is unbound by default.
     menu-complete-backward
            Identical  to menu-complete, but moves backward through the list of
            possible completions, as if menu-complete had been given a negative
            argument.  This command is unbound by default.
     export-completions
            Perform completion on the word before point as described above  and
            write  the list of possible completions to readline's output stream
            using the following format, writing information on separate lines:

            *      the number of matches N;
            *      the word being completed;
            *      S:E, where S and E are the start and end offsets of the word
                   in the readline line buffer; then
            *      each match, one per line

            If there are no matches, the first line will be "0", and this  com-
            mand  does  not print any output after the S:E.  If there is only a
            single match, this prints a single line containing it.  If there is
            more than one match, this prints the common prefix of the  matches,
            which  may  be  empty,  on  the  first line after the S:E, then the
            matches on subsequent lines.  In this  case,  N  will  include  the
            first line with the common prefix.

            The user or application should be able to accommodate the possibil-
            ity  of  a  blank line.  The intent is that the user or application
            reads N lines after the line containing S:E  to  obtain  the  match
            list.  This command is unbound by default.

     delete-char-or-list
            Deletes  the  character under the cursor if not at the beginning or
            end of the line (like delete-char).  At the end of the line, it be-
            haves identically to possible-completions.  This command is unbound
            by default.

     complete-filename (M-/)
            Attempt filename completion on the text before point.

     possible-filename-completions (C-x /)
            List the possible completions of the text before point, treating it
            as a filename.

     complete-username (M-~)
            Attempt completion on the text before point, treating it as a user-
            name.

     possible-username-completions (C-x ~)
            List the possible completions of the text before point, treating it
            as a username.

     complete-variable (M-$)
            Attempt completion on the text before point, treating it as a shell
            variable.

     possible-variable-completions (C-x $)
            List the possible completions of the text before point, treating it
            as a shell variable.

     complete-hostname (M-@)
            Attempt completion on the text before point, treating it as a host-
            name.

     possible-hostname-completions (C-x @)
            List the possible completions of the text before point, treating it
            as a hostname.

     complete-command (M-!)
            Attempt completion on the text before point, treating it as a  com-
            mand  name.   Command completion attempts to match the text against
            aliases, reserved words, shell functions, shell builtins,  and  fi-
            nally executable filenames, in that order.

     possible-command-completions (C-x !)
            List the possible completions of the text before point, treating it
            as a command name.

     dynamic-complete-history (M-TAB)
            Attempt  completion  on  the  text before point, comparing the text
            against history list entries for possible completion matches.

     dabbrev-expand
            Attempt menu completion on the text  before  point,  comparing  the
            text  against  lines  from the history list for possible completion
            matches.

     complete-into-braces (M-{)
            Perform filename completion and insert the list of possible comple-
            tions enclosed within braces so the list is available to the  shell
            (see Brace Expansion above).

   Keyboard Macros

            Begin saving the characters typed into the current keyboard macro.
     end-kbd-macro (C-x ))
            Stop  saving  the  characters typed into the current keyboard macro
            and store the definition.
     call-last-kbd-macro (C-x e)
            Re-execute the last keyboard macro defined, by making  the  charac-
            ters in the macro appear as if typed at the keyboard.
     print-last-kbd-macro ()
            Print  the last keyboard macro defined in a format suitable for the
            inputrc file.

   Miscellaneous
     re-read-init-file (C-x C-r)
            Read in the contents of the inputrc file, and incorporate any bind-
            ings or variable assignments found there.
     abort (C-g)
            Abort the current editing command  and  ring  the  terminal's  bell
            (subject to the setting of bell-style).
     do-lowercase-version (M-A, M-B, M-x, ...)
            If  the  metafied character x is uppercase, run the command that is
            bound to the corresponding metafied lowercase character.   The  be-
            havior is undefined if x is already lowercase.
     prefix-meta (ESC)
            Metafy the next character typed.  ESC f is equivalent to Meta-f.
     undo (C-_, C-x C-u)
            Incremental undo, separately remembered for each line.
     revert-line (M-r)
            Undo  all  changes  made  to this line.  This is like executing the
            undo command enough times to return the line to its initial state.
     tilde-expand (M-&)
            Perform tilde expansion on the current word.
     set-mark (C-@, M-<space>)
            Set the mark to the point.  If a numeric argument is supplied,  set
            the mark to that position.
     exchange-point-and-mark (C-x C-x)
            Swap  the  point with the mark.  Set the current cursor position to
            the saved position, then set the mark to the old cursor position.
     character-search (C-])
            Read a character and move point to  the  next  occurrence  of  that
            character.  A negative argument searches for previous occurrences.
     character-search-backward (M-C-])
            Read  a character and move point to the previous occurrence of that
            character.  A negative  argument  searches  for  subsequent  occur-
            rences.
     skip-csi-sequence
            Read  enough  characters  to  consume  a multi-key sequence such as
            those defined for keys like Home and End.  CSI sequences begin with
            a Control Sequence Indicator (CSI), usually ESC  [.   If  this  se-
            quence  is bound to "\e[", keys producing CSI sequences have no ef-
            fect unless explicitly bound to a readline command, instead of  in-
            serting  stray characters into the editing buffer.  This is unbound
            by default, but usually bound to ESC [.
     insert-comment (M-#)
            Without a numeric argument, insert the value of the  readline  com-
            ment-begin variable at the beginning of the current line.  If a nu-
            meric  argument  is supplied, this command acts as a toggle: if the
            characters at the beginning of the line do not match the  value  of
            comment-begin, insert the value; otherwise delete the characters in
            comment-begin  from the beginning of the line.  In either case, the
            line is accepted as if a newline had been typed.  The default value
            of comment-begin causes this command to make  the  current  line  a
            shell  comment.  If a numeric argument causes the comment character
            to be removed, the line will be executed by the shell.
     spell-correct-word (C-x s)
            Perform spelling correction on the current word, treating it  as  a
            directory or filename, in the same way as the cdspell shell option.
            Word boundaries are the same as those used by shell-forward-word.
     glob-complete-word (M-g)
            Treat  the  word  before point as a pattern for pathname expansion,
            with an asterisk implicitly appended, then use the pattern to  gen-
            erate a list of matching file names for possible completions.
     glob-expand-word (C-x *)
            Treat  the  word  before point as a pattern for pathname expansion,
            and insert the list of matching file names, replacing the word.  If
            a numeric argument is supplied, append a * before  pathname  expan-
            sion.
     glob-list-expansions (C-x g)
            Display  the  list  of expansions that would have been generated by
            glob-expand-word and redisplay the line.  If a numeric argument  is
            supplied, append a * before pathname expansion.
     dump-functions
            Print  all  of the functions and their key bindings to the readline
            output stream.  If a numeric argument is supplied,  the  output  is
            formatted  in  such  a  way  that it can be made part of an inputrc
            file.
     dump-variables
            Print all of the settable readline variables and  their  values  to
            the readline output stream.  If a numeric argument is supplied, the
            output  is  formatted  in such a way that it can be made part of an
            inputrc file.
     dump-macros
            Print all of the readline key sequences bound  to  macros  and  the
            strings  they  output  to the readline output stream.  If a numeric
            argument is supplied, the output is formatted in such a way that it
            can be made part of an inputrc file.
     execute-named-command (M-x)
            Read a bindable readline command name from the  input  and  execute
            the  function  to which it's bound, as if the key sequence to which
            it was bound appeared in the input.  If this function  is  supplied
            with a numeric argument, it passes that argument to the function it
            executes.
     display-shell-version (C-x C-v)
            Display version information about the current instance of bash.

   Programmable Completion
     When  a  user  attempts  word completion for a command or an argument to a
     command for which a completion specification (a compspec) has been defined
     using the complete builtin (see SHELL BUILTIN  COMMANDS  below),  readline
     invokes the programmable completion facilities.

     First,  bash  identifies the command name.  If a compspec has been defined
     for that command, the compspec is used to generate the  list  of  possible
     completions  for  the word.  If the command word is the empty string (com-
     pletion attempted at the beginning of an empty line), bash uses any  comp-
     spec  defined  with  the -E option to complete.  The -I option to complete
     indicates that the command word is the first non-assignment  word  on  the
     line, or after a command delimiter such as ; or |.  This usually indicates
     command name completion.

     If  the  command word is a full pathname, bash searches for a compspec for
     the full pathname first.  If there is no compspec for the  full  pathname,
     bash  attempts  to  find  a  compspec  for the portion following the final
     slash.  If those searches do not result in a compspec, or if there  is  no
     compspec  for the command word, bash uses any compspec defined with the -D
     option to complete as the default.  If there is no default compspec,  bash
     performs  alias  expansion  on the command word as a final resort, and at-
     tempts to find a compspec for the command word resulting from any success-
     ful expansion.

     If a compspec is not found, bash performs its default  completion  as  de-
     scribed  above  under  Completing.   Otherwise,  once  a compspec has been
     found, bash uses it to generate the list of matching words.

     First, bash performs the actions specified by the compspec.  This only re-
     turns matches which are prefixes of the word being completed.  When the -f
     or -d option is used for filename or directory name completion, bash  uses
     the shell variable FIGNORE to filter the matches.

     Next,  programmable  completion  generates matches specified by a pathname
     expansion pattern supplied as an argument to the  -G  option.   The  words
     generated  by  the  pattern need not match the word being completed.  Bash
     uses the FIGNORE variable to filter the matches, but does not use the GLO-
     BIGNORE shell variable.

     Next, completion considers the string specified as the argument to the  -W
     option.  The string is first split using the characters in the IFS special
     variable  as  delimiters.  This honors shell quoting within the string, in
     order to provide a mechanism for the words to contain shell metacharacters
     or characters in the value of IFS.  Each word is then expanded using brace
     expansion, tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, command sub-
     stitution, and arithmetic expansion, as described above  under  EXPANSION.
     The  results  are  split using the rules described above under Word Split-
     ting.  The results of the expansion are prefix-matched  against  the  word
     being completed, and the matching words become possible completions.

     After  these matches have been generated, bash executes any shell function
     or command specified with the -F and -C  options.   When  the  command  or
     function  is  invoked,  bash  assigns values to the COMP_LINE, COMP_POINT,
     COMP_KEY, and COMP_TYPE variables as described  above  under  Shell  Vari-
     ables.   If  a  shell  function  is  being  invoked,  bash  also  sets the
     COMP_WORDS and COMP_CWORD variables.  When the function or command is  in-
     voked,  the first argument ($1) is the name of the command whose arguments
     are being completed, the second argument ($2) is the word being completed,
     and the third argument ($3) is the word preceding the word being completed
     on the current command line.  There is no filtering of the generated  com-
     pletions  against  the  word  being completed; the function or command has
     complete freedom in generating the matches and they do not need to match a
     prefix of the word.

     Any function specified with -F is invoked first.  The function may use any
     of the shell facilities, including the compgen and  compopt  builtins  de-
     scribed  below, to generate the matches.  It must put the possible comple-
     tions in the COMPREPLY array variable, one per array element.

     Next, any command specified with the -C option is invoked in  an  environ-
     ment  equivalent  to command substitution.  It should print a list of com-
     pletions, one per line, to the standard output.  Backslash will  escape  a
     newline,  if  necessary.   These  are added to the set of possible comple-
     tions.

     After generating all of the possible completions, bash applies any  filter
     specified  with  the -X option to the completions in the list.  The filter
     is a pattern as used for pathname expansion; a & in  the  pattern  is  re-
     placed  with the text of the word being completed.  A literal & may be es-
     caped with a backslash; the  backslash  is  removed  before  attempting  a
     match.   Any completion that matches the pattern is removed from the list.
     A leading ! negates the pattern; in this case bash removes any  completion
     that  does  not match the pattern.  If the nocasematch shell option is en-
     abled, bash performs the match without regard to the  case  of  alphabetic
     characters.

     Finally, programmable completion adds any prefix and suffix specified with
     the  -P  and -S options, respectively, to each completion, and returns the
     result to readline as the list of possible completions.

     If the previously-applied actions do not generate any matches, and the  -o
     dirnames  option  was  supplied to complete when the compspec was defined,
     bash attempts directory name completion.

     If the -o plusdirs option was supplied to complete when the  compspec  was
     defined,  bash  attempts directory name completion and adds any matches to
     the set of possible completions.

     By default, if a compspec is found, whatever it generates is  returned  to
     the  completion code as the full set of possible completions.  The default
     bash completions and the readline default of filename completion are  dis-
     abled.   If  the  -o  bashdefault option was supplied to complete when the
     compspec was defined, and the compspec generates no matches, bash attempts
     its default completions.  If the compspec and, if attempted,  the  default
     bash  completions  generate no matches, and the -o default option was sup-
     plied to complete when the compspec was defined,  programmable  completion
     performs readline's default completion.

     The  options  supplied  to  complete  and compopt can control how readline
     treats the completions.  For instance, the -o fullquote option tells read-
     line to quote the matches as if they were filenames.  See the  description
     of complete below for details.

     When  a  compspec  indicates  that it wants directory name completion, the
     programmable completion functions force readline to append a slash to com-
     pleted names which are symbolic links to directories, subject to the value
     of the mark-directories readline variable, regardless of  the  setting  of
     the mark-symlinked-directories readline variable.

     There is some support for dynamically modifying completions.  This is most
     useful  when  used in combination with a default completion specified with
     complete -D.  It's possible for shell  functions  executed  as  completion
     functions  to  indicate  that completion should be retried by returning an
     exit status of 124.  If a shell function  returns  124,  and  changes  the
     compspec  associated  with  the  command  on which completion is being at-
     tempted (supplied as the first argument when the  function  is  executed),
     programmable  completion  restarts  from the beginning, with an attempt to
     find a new compspec for that command.  This can be used to build a set  of
     completions  dynamically  as  completion is attempted, rather than loading
     them all at once.

     For instance, assuming that there is a library of compspecs, each kept  in
     a  file  corresponding  to  the name of the command, the following default
     completion function would load completions dynamically:
            _completion_loader()
            {
              . "/etc/bash_completion.d/$1.sh" \
                >/dev/null 2>&1 && return 124
            }
            complete -D -F _completion_loader \
                -o bashdefault -o default

HISTORY
     When the -o history option to the set builtin is enabled, the  shell  pro-
     vides  access  to  the  command  history,  the list of commands previously
     typed.  The value of the HISTSIZE variable is used as the number  of  com-
     mands  to  save  in  a  history list: the shell saves the text of the last
     HISTSIZE commands (default 500).  The shell stores  each  command  in  the
     history  list  prior  to  parameter  and variable expansion (see EXPANSION
     above) but after history expansion is performed, subject to the values  of
     the shell variables HISTIGNORE and HISTCONTROL.

     On  startup,  bash initializes the history list by reading history entries
     from the file named by the HISTFILE  variable  (default  ~/.bash_history).
     That  file  is referred to as the history file.  The history file is trun-
     cated, if necessary, to contain no more than the number of history entries
     specified by the value of the HISTFILESIZE variable.  If  HISTFILESIZE  is
     unset,  or  set to null, a non-numeric value, or a numeric value less than
     zero, the history file is not truncated.

     When the history file is read, lines beginning with  the  history  comment
     character  followed  immediately  by a digit are interpreted as timestamps
     for the following history line.  These timestamps are optionally displayed
     depending on the value of the HISTTIMEFORMAT variable.  When present, his-
     tory timestamps delimit history entries, making multi-line entries  possi-
     ble.

     When  a  shell  with history enabled exits, bash copies the last $HISTSIZE
     entries from the history list to $HISTFILE.  If the histappend  shell  op-
     tion is enabled (see the description of shopt under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
     below),  bash  appends the entries to the history file, otherwise it over-
     writes the history file.  If HISTFILE is unset or null, or if the  history
     file  is  unwritable, the history is not saved.  After saving the history,
     bash truncates the history file to contain no more than HISTFILESIZE lines
     as described above.

     If the HISTTIMEFORMAT variable is set, the shell writes the timestamp  in-
     formation  associated  with each history entry to the history file, marked
     with the history comment character, so  timestamps  are  preserved  across
     shell  sessions.   This  uses the history comment character to distinguish
     timestamps from other history lines.  As above, when using HISTTIMEFORMAT,
     the timestamps delimit multi-line history entries.

     The fc builtin command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS  below)  will  list  or
     edit  and  re-execute  a portion of the history list.  The history builtin
     can display or modify the history list and manipulate  the  history  file.
     When  using  command-line  editing,  search commands are available in each
     editing mode that provide access to the history list.

     The shell allows control over which commands  are  saved  on  the  history
     list.   The  HISTCONTROL  and HISTIGNORE variables are used to save only a
     subset of the commands entered.  If the cmdhist shell option  is  enabled,
     the  shell  attempts to save each line of a multi-line command in the same
     history entry, adding semicolons where  necessary  to  preserve  syntactic
     correctness.  The lithist shell option modifies cmdhist by saving the com-
     mand with embedded newlines instead of semicolons.  See the description of
     the  shopt  builtin  below under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS for information on
     setting and unsetting shell options.

HISTORY EXPANSION
     The shell supports a history expansion feature that is similar to the his-
     tory expansion in csh.  This section describes what  syntax  features  are
     available.

     History expansion is enabled by default for interactive shells, and can be
     disabled using the +H option to the set builtin command (see SHELL BUILTIN
     COMMANDS  below).  Non-interactive shells do not perform history expansion
     by default, but it can be enabled with "set -H".

     History expansions introduce words from the history list  into  the  input
     stream,  making it easy to repeat commands, insert the arguments to a pre-
     vious command into the current input line, or fix errors in previous  com-
     mands quickly.

     History  expansion is performed immediately after a complete line is read,
     before the shell breaks it into words, and is performed on each line indi-
     vidually.  The shell attempts to inform the  history  expansion  functions
     about quoting still in effect from previous lines.

     It takes place in two parts.  The first is to determine which history list
     entry  to  use  during  substitution.  The second is to select portions of
     that entry to include into the current one.

     The entry selected from the history is the event, and the portions of that
     entry that are acted upon are words.  Various modifiers are  available  to
     manipulate  the selected words.  The entry is split into words in the same
     fashion as when reading input,  so  that  several  metacharacter-separated
     words  surrounded by quotes are considered one word.  The event designator
     selects the event, the optional word designator  selects  words  from  the
     event,  and various optional modifiers are available to manipulate the se-
     lected words.

     History expansions are introduced by the appearance of the history  expan-
     sion character, which is ! by default.  History expansions may appear any-
     where in the input, but do not nest.

     Only backslash (\) and single quotes can quote the history expansion char-
     acter, but the history expansion character is also treated as quoted if it
     immediately precedes the closing double quote in a double-quoted string.

     Several  characters inhibit history expansion if found immediately follow-
     ing the history expansion character, even if it is unquoted:  space,  tab,
     newline,  carriage  return,  =, and the other shell metacharacters defined
     above.

     There is a special abbreviation for substitution, active  when  the  quick
     substitution  character  (described  above  under  histchars) is the first
     character on the line.  It selects the previous history list entry,  using
     an  event  designator equivalent to !!, and substitutes one string for an-
     other in that entry.  It is described below under Event Designators.  This
     is the only history expansion that does not begin with the history  expan-
     sion character.

     Several  shell options settable with the shopt builtin will modify history
     expansion behavior (see the description of the shopt builtin below).and If
     the histverify shell option is enabled, and readline is being  used,  his-
     tory  substitutions  are  not immediately passed to the shell parser.  In-
     stead, the expanded line is reloaded into the readline editing buffer  for
     further modification.  If readline is being used, and the histreedit shell
     option  is  enabled,  a  failed  history substitution is reloaded into the
     readline editing buffer for correction.

     The -p option to the history builtin command shows what a  history  expan-
     sion  will  do before using it.  The -s option to the history builtin will
     add commands to the end of the history  list  without  actually  executing
     them, so that they are available for subsequent recall.

     The shell allows control of the various characters used by the history ex-
     pansion  mechanism  (see  the  description  of histchars above under Shell
     Variables).  The shell uses the history comment character to mark  history
     timestamps when writing the history file.

   Event Designators
     An  event  designator is a reference to an entry in the history list.  The
     event designator consists of the portion of the word  beginning  with  the
     history  expansion  character  and  ending  with  the  word  designator if
     present, or the end of the word.  Unless the reference is absolute, events
     are relative to the current position in the history list.

     !      Start a history substitution, except when followed by a blank, new-
            line, carriage return, =, or, when the extglob shell option is  en-
            abled using the shopt builtin, (.
     !n     Refer to history list entry n.
     !-n    Refer to the current entry minus n.
     !!     Refer to the previous entry.  This is a synonym for "!-1".
     !string
            Refer  to the most recent command preceding the current position in
            the history list starting with string.
     !?string[?]
            Refer to the most recent command preceding the current position  in
            the  history list containing string.  The trailing ? may be omitted
            if string is followed immediately by a newline.  If string is miss-
            ing, this uses the string from the most recent search; it is an er-
            ror if there is no previous search string.
     ^string1^string2^
            Quick substitution.  Repeat the previous command, replacing string1
            with string2.  Equivalent to "!!:s^string1^string2^" (see Modifiers
            below).
     !#     The entire command line typed so far.

   Word Designators
     Word designators are used to select desired words from  the  event.   They
     are optional; if the word designator isn't supplied, the history expansion
     uses  the  entire  event.   A : separates the event specification from the
     word designator.  It may be omitted if the word designator begins  with  a
     ^, $, *, -, or %.  Words are numbered from the beginning of the line, with
     the  first  word  being  denoted by 0 (zero).  Words are inserted into the
     current line separated by single spaces.

     0 (zero)
            The zeroth word.  For the shell, this is the command word.
     n      The nth word.
     ^      The first argument: word 1.
     $      The last word.  This is usually the last argument, but will  expand
            to the zeroth word if there is only one word in the line.
     %      The  first  word  matched by the most recent "?string?"  search, if
            the search string begins with a character that is part of  a  word.
            By  default,  searches begin at the end of each line and proceed to
            the beginning, so the first word matched is the one closest to  the
            end of the line.
     x-y    A range of words; "-y" abbreviates "0-y".
     *      All  of the words but the zeroth.  This is a synonym for "1-$".  It
            is not an error to use * if there is just one word in the event; it
            expands to the empty string in that case.
     x*     Abbreviates x-$.
     x-     Abbreviates x-$ like x*, but omits the last word.  If x is missing,
            it defaults to 0.

     If a word designator is supplied without an event specification, the  pre-
     vious command is used as the event, equivalent to !!.

   Modifiers
     After  the  optional word designator, the expansion may include a sequence
     of one or more of the following modifiers, each preceded by a ":".   These
     modify, or edit, the word or words selected from the history event.

     h      Remove a trailing pathname component, leaving only the head.
     t      Remove all leading pathname components, leaving the tail.
     r      Remove a trailing suffix of the form .xxx, leaving the basename.
     e      Remove all but the trailing suffix.
     p      Print the new command but do not execute it.
     q      Quote the substituted words, escaping further substitutions.
     x      Quote  the  substituted  words  as  with q, but break into words at
            blanks and newlines.  The q and x modifiers are mutually exclusive;
            expansion uses the last one supplied.
     s/old/new/
            Substitute new for the first occurrence of old in the  event  line.
            Any  character may be used as the delimiter in place of /.  The fi-
            nal delimiter is optional if it is the last character of the  event
            line.   A single backslash quotes the delimiter in old and new.  If
            & appears in new, it is replaced  with  old.   A  single  backslash
            quotes  the  &.   If old is null, it is set to the last old substi-
            tuted, or, if no previous history  substitutions  took  place,  the
            last  string in a !?string[?]  search.  If new is null, each match-
            ing old is deleted.
     &      Repeat the previous substitution.
     g      Cause changes to be applied over the entire event  line.   This  is
            used  in  conjunction with ":s" (e.g., ":gs/old/new/") or ":&".  If
            used with ":s", any delimiter can be used in place of  /,  and  the
            final  delimiter  is  optional  if  it is the last character of the
            event line.  An a may be used as a synonym for g.
     G      Apply the following "s" or "&" modifier once to each  word  in  the
            event line.

SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
     Unless otherwise noted, each builtin command documented in this section as
     accepting  options  preceded by - accepts -- to signify the end of the op-
     tions.  The :, true, false, and test/[ builtins do not accept options  and
     do  not  treat  --  specially.  The exit, logout, return, break, continue,
     let, and shift builtins accept and  process  arguments  beginning  with  -
     without  requiring  --.   Other builtins that accept arguments but are not
     specified as accepting options interpret arguments beginning with - as in-
     valid options and require -- to prevent this interpretation.

     : [arguments]
            No effect; the command does nothing beyond expanding arguments  and
            performing any specified redirections.  The return status is zero.

     . [-p path] filename [arguments]
     source [-p path] filename [arguments]
            The  . command (source) reads and execute commands from filename in
            the current shell environment and returns the exit  status  of  the
            last command executed from filename.

            If filename does not contain a slash, . searches for it.  If the -p
            option  is supplied, . treats path as a colon-separated list of di-
            rectories in which to find filename; otherwise, . uses the  entries
            in  PATH  to find the directory containing filename.  filename does
            not need to be executable.  When bash is  not  in  posix  mode,  it
            searches  the  current  directory if filename is not found in PATH,
            but does not search the current directory if -p  is  supplied.   If
            the sourcepath option to the shopt builtin command is turned off, .
            does not search PATH.

            If  any  arguments are supplied, they become the positional parame-
            ters when filename is executed.  Otherwise the  positional  parame-
            ters are unchanged.

            If the -T option is enabled, . inherits any trap on DEBUG; if it is
            not, any DEBUG trap string is saved and restored around the call to
            .,  and  .  unsets  the DEBUG trap while it executes.  If -T is not
            set, and the sourced file changes the DEBUG  trap,  the  new  value
            persists after . completes.  The return status is the status of the
            last  command  executed  from  filename  (0 if no commands are exe-
            cuted), and non-zero if filename is not found or cannot be read.

     alias [-p] [name[=value] ...]
            With no arguments or with the -p option, alias prints the  list  of
            aliases  in the form alias name=value on standard output.  When ar-
            guments are supplied, define an alias for each name whose value  is
            given.   A  trailing  space  in  value  causes  the next word to be
            checked for alias substitution when the alias  is  expanded  during
            command  parsing.   For each name in the argument list for which no
            value is supplied, print the name and  value  of  the  alias  name.
            alias  returns true unless a name is given (without a corresponding
            =value) for which no alias has been defined.

     bg [jobspec ...]
            Resume each suspended job jobspec in the background, as if  it  had
            been started with &.  If jobspec is not present, the shell uses its
            notion  of  the  current job.  bg jobspec returns 0 unless run when
            job control is disabled or, when run with job control enabled,  any
            specified jobspec was not found or was started without job control.

     bind [-m keymap] [-lsvSVX]
     bind [-m keymap] [-q function] [-u function] [-r keyseq]
     bind [-m keymap] -f filename
     bind [-m keymap] -x keyseq[:] shell-command
     bind [-m keymap] keyseq:function-name
     bind [-m keymap] -p|-P [readline-command]
     bind [-m keymap] keyseq:readline-command
     bind readline-command-line
            Display  current readline key and function bindings, bind a key se-
            quence to a readline function or macro or to a  shell  command,  or
            set a readline variable.  Each non-option argument is a key binding
            or  command  as  it  would appear in a readline initialization file
            such as .inputrc, but each binding or command must be passed  as  a
            separate  argument;  e.g., '"\C-x\C-r": re-read-init-file'.  In the
            following descriptions, output available to be re-read is formatted
            as commands that would appear in a readline initialization file  or
            that  would  be supplied as individual arguments to a bind command.
            Options, if supplied, have the following meanings:
            -m keymap
                   Use keymap as the keymap to be affected  by  the  subsequent
                   bindings.   Acceptable  keymap  names are emacs, emacs-stan-
                   dard, emacs-meta, emacs-ctlx, vi, vi-move,  vi-command,  and
                   vi-insert.   vi is equivalent to vi-command (vi-move is also
                   a synonym); emacs is equivalent to emacs-standard.
            -l     List the names of all readline functions.
            -p     Display readline function names and bindings in such  a  way
                   that  they  can  be used as an argument to a subsequent bind
                   command or in a readline initialization file.  If  arguments
                   remain after option processing, bind treats them as readline
                   command names and restricts output to those names.
            -P     List current readline function names and bindings.  If argu-
                   ments  remain  after  option processing, bind treats them as
                   readline command names and restricts output to those names.
            -s     Display readline key  sequences  bound  to  macros  and  the
                   strings  they  output in such a way that they can be used as
                   an argument to a subsequent bind command or  in  a  readline
                   initialization file.
            -S     Display  readline  key  sequences  bound  to  macros and the
                   strings they output.
            -v     Display readline variable names and values  in  such  a  way
                   that  they  can  be used as an argument to a subsequent bind
                   command or in a readline initialization file.
            -V     List current readline variable names and values.
            -f filename
                   Read key bindings from filename.
            -q function
                   Display key sequences that invoke the named  readline  func-
                   tion.
            -u function
                   Unbind  all  key sequences bound to the named readline func-
                   tion.
            -r keyseq
                   Remove any current binding for keyseq.
            -x keyseq[: ]shell-command
                   Cause shell-command to be executed whenever  keyseq  is  en-
                   tered.   The  separator  between keyseq and shell-command is
                   either whitespace or a colon optionally followed  by  white-
                   space.   If  the separator is whitespace, shell-command must
                   be enclosed in double quotes and readline expands any of its
                   special backslash-escapes in shell-command before saving it.
                   If the separator is a colon, any enclosing double quotes are
                   optional, and readline does not expand  the  command  string
                   before  saving  it.  Since the entire key binding expression
                   must be a single argument, it should be enclosed  in  single
                   quotes.   When shell-command is executed, the shell sets the
                   READLINE_LINE variable to the contents of the readline  line
                   buffer and the READLINE_POINT and READLINE_MARK variables to
                   the  current  location  of the insertion point and the saved
                   insertion point (the mark), respectively.  The shell assigns
                   any numeric argument the user supplied to the READLINE_ARGU-
                   MENT variable.  If there was no argument, that  variable  is
                   not  set.   If the executed command changes the value of any
                   of READLINE_LINE, READLINE_POINT,  or  READLINE_MARK,  those
                   new values will be reflected in the editing state.
            -X     List all key sequences bound to shell commands and the asso-
                   ciated  commands  in a format that can be reused as an argu-
                   ment to a subsequent bind command.

            The return value is 0 unless an unrecognized option is supplied  or
            an error occurred.

     break [n]
            Exit  from  within  a  for,  while, until, or select loop.  If n is
            specified, break exits n enclosing loops.  n must be >= 1.  If n is
            greater than the number of enclosing loops, all enclosing loops are
            exited.  The return value is 0 unless n  is  not  greater  than  or
            equal to 1.

     builtin shell-builtin [arguments]
            Execute the specified shell builtin shell-builtin, passing it argu-
            ments,  and return its exit status.  This is useful when defining a
            function whose name is the same as a shell builtin,  retaining  the
            functionality  of  the builtin within the function.  The cd builtin
            is commonly redefined this way.  The  return  status  is  false  if
            shell-builtin is not a shell builtin command.

     caller [expr]
            Returns the context of any active subroutine call (a shell function
            or a script executed with the . or source builtins).

            Without  expr,  caller displays the line number and source filename
            of the current subroutine call.  If a non-negative integer is  sup-
            plied  as  expr,  caller displays the line number, subroutine name,
            and source file corresponding to that position in the current  exe-
            cution  call  stack.  This extra information may be used, for exam-
            ple, to print a stack trace.  The current frame is frame 0.

            The return value is 0 unless the shell is not executing  a  subrou-
            tine  call  or  expr does not correspond to a valid position in the
            call stack.

     cd [-L] [-@] [dir]
     cd -P [-e] [-@] [dir]
            Change the current directory to dir.  if dir is not  supplied,  the
            value  of the HOME shell variable is used as dir.  The variable CD-
            PATH exists, and dir does not begin with a slash (/), cd uses it as
            a search path: the shell searches each directory name in CDPATH for
            dir.  Alternative directory names in  CDPATH  are  separated  by  a
            colon (:).  A null directory name in CDPATH is the same as the cur-
            rent directory, i.e., ".".

            The  -P option causes cd to use the physical directory structure by
            resolving symbolic links while traversing dir and before processing
            instances of .. in dir (see also the -P option to the  set  builtin
            command).

            The  -L  option forces cd to follow symbolic links by resolving the
            link after processing instances of .. in dir.   If  ..  appears  in
            dir,  cd processes it by removing the immediately previous pathname
            component from dir, back to a slash or the beginning  of  dir,  and
            verifying that the portion of dir it has processed to that point is
            still a valid directory name after removing the pathname component.
            If  it is not a valid directory name, cd returns a non-zero status.
            If neither -L nor -P is supplied, cd behaves as if -L had been sup-
            plied.

            If the -e option is supplied with -P, and  cd  cannot  successfully
            determine  the  current working directory after a successful direc-
            tory change, it returns a non-zero status.

            On systems that support it, the -@ option presents the extended at-
            tributes associated with a file as a directory.

            An argument of - is converted to $OLDPWD before attempting the  di-
            rectory change.

            If  cd  uses a non-empty directory name from CDPATH, or if - is the
            first argument, and the directory change is successful,  cd  writes
            the  absolute pathname of the new working directory to the standard
            output.

            If the directory change is successful, cd sets the value of the PWD
            environment variable to the new directory name, and sets the OLDPWD
            environment variable to the value of the current working  directory
            before the change.

            The return value is true if the directory was successfully changed;
            false otherwise.

     command [-pVv] command [arg ...]
            The  command  builtin runs command with args suppressing the normal
            shell function lookup for command.  Only builtin commands  or  com-
            mands  found in the PATH named command are executed.  If the -p op-
            tion is supplied, the search for command is performed using  a  de-
            fault value for PATH that is guaranteed to find all of the standard
            utilities.

            If  either  the  -V  or -v option is supplied, command prints a de-
            scription of command.  The -v option displays a single  word  indi-
            cating  the  command or filename used to invoke command; the -V op-
            tion produces a more verbose description.

            If the -V or -v option is supplied, the exit status is zero if com-
            mand was found, and non-zero if not.  If neither option is supplied
            and an error occurred or command cannot be found, the  exit  status
            is  127.   Otherwise, the exit status of the command builtin is the
            exit status of command.

     compgen [-V varname] [option] [word]
            Generate possible completion matches for word according to the  op-
            tions,  which  may  be  any option accepted by the complete builtin
            with the exceptions of -p, -r,  -D,  -E,  and  -I,  and  write  the
            matches to the standard output.

            If  the -V option is supplied, compgen stores the generated comple-
            tions into the indexed array variable varname  instead  of  writing
            them to the standard output.

            When using the -F or -C options, the various shell variables set by
            the  programmable  completion facilities, while available, will not
            have useful values.

            The matches will be generated in the same way as if the  programma-
            ble  completion  code had generated them directly from a completion
            specification with the same flags.   If  word  is  specified,  only
            those completions matching word will be displayed or stored.

            The  return  value is true unless an invalid option is supplied, or
            no matches were generated.

     complete [-abcdefgjksuv] [-o comp-option] [-DEI] [-A action]
            [-G globpat] [-W wordlist] [-F function] [-C command]
            [-X filterpat] [-P prefix] [-S suffix] name [name ...]
     complete -pr [-DEI] [name ...]
            Specify how arguments to each name should be completed.

            If the -p option is supplied, or if no options or  names  are  sup-
            plied,  print  existing completion specifications in a way that al-
            lows them to be reused as input.  The -r option removes  a  comple-
            tion specification for each name, or, if no names are supplied, all
            completion specifications.

            The  -D  option  indicates  that other supplied options and actions
            should apply to the "default" command completion; that is,  comple-
            tion  attempted on a command for which no completion has previously
            been defined.  The -E option indicates that other supplied  options
            and  actions  should  apply to "empty" command completion; that is,
            completion attempted on a blank line.  The -I option indicates that
            other supplied options and actions should apply  to  completion  on
            the initial non-assignment word on the line, or after a command de-
            limiter  such  as ; or |, which is usually command name completion.
            If multiple options are supplied, the -D  option  takes  precedence
            over -E, and both take precedence over -I.  If any of -D, -E, or -I
            are  supplied,  any other name arguments are ignored; these comple-
            tions only apply to the case specified by the option.

            The process of applying these completion  specifications  when  at-
            tempting  word  completion   is  described above under Programmable
            Completion.

            Other options, if specified, have the following meanings.  The  ar-
            guments  to  the  -G, -W, and -X options (and, if necessary, the -P
            and -S options) should be quoted to protect them from expansion be-
            fore the complete builtin is invoked.

            -o comp-option
                    The comp-option controls several aspects of the  compspec's
                    behavior  beyond  the  simple  generation  of  completions.
                    comp-option may be one of:
                    bashdefault
                            Perform the rest of the default bash completions if
                            the compspec generates no matches.
                    default
                            Use readline's default filename completion  if  the
                            compspec generates no matches.
                    dirnames
                            Perform  directory  name completion if the compspec
                            generates no matches.
                    filenames
                            Tell readline that  the  compspec  generates  file-
                            names, so it can perform any filename-specific pro-
                            cessing (such as adding a slash to directory names,
                            quoting special characters, or suppressing trailing
                            spaces).   This  is  intended to be used with shell
                            functions.
                    fullquote
                            Tell readline to quote all the completed words even
                            if they are not filenames.
                    noquote
                            Tell readline not to quote the completed  words  if
                            they  are  filenames  (quoting filenames is the de-
                            fault).
                    nosort  Tell readline not to sort the list of possible com-
                            pletions alphabetically.
                    nospace
                            Tell readline not to append a space  (the  default)
                            to words completed at the end of the line.
                    plusdirs
                            After  generating  any matches defined by the comp-
                            spec, attempt directory name completion and add any
                            matches to the results of the other actions.
            -A action
                    The action may be one of the following to generate  a  list
                    of possible completions:
                    alias   Alias names.  May also be specified as -a.
                    arrayvar
                            Array variable names.
                    binding

                    builtin
                            Names of shell builtin commands.  May also be spec-
                            ified as -b.
                    command
                            Command names.  May also be specified as -c.
                    directory
                            Directory names.  May also be specified as -d.

                    export  Names  of  exported  shell  variables.  May also be
                            specified as -e.
                    file    File and directory  names,  similar  to  readline's
                            filename completion.  May also be specified as -f.
                    function
                            Names of shell functions.
                    group   Group names.  May also be specified as -g.
                    helptopic
                            Help topics as accepted by the help builtin.
                    hostname
                            Hostnames,  as taken from the file specified by the
                            HOSTFILE shell variable.
                    job     Job names, if job control is active.  May  also  be

                    keyword
                            Shell reserved words.  May also be specified as -k.
                    running
                            Names of running jobs, if job control is active.
                    service
                            Service names.  May also be specified as -s.
                    setopt  Valid  arguments  for  the  -o  option  to  the set
                            builtin.
                    shopt   Shell  option  names  as  accepted  by  the   shopt
                            builtin.
                    signal  Signal names.
                    stopped
                            Names of stopped jobs, if job control is active.
                    user    User names.  May also be specified as -u.
                    variable
                            Names  of  all shell variables.  May also be speci-
                            fied as -v.
            -C command
                    command is executed in a subshell environment, and its out-
                    put is used as the  possible  completions.   Arguments  are
                    passed as with the -F option.
            -F function
                    The  shell  function  function  is  executed in the current
                    shell environment.  When  the  function  is  executed,  the
                    first  argument ($1) is the name of the command whose argu-
                    ments are being completed, the second argument ($2) is  the
                    word  being  completed,  and the third argument ($3) is the
                    word preceding the word being completed on the current com-
                    mand line.  When function finishes, programmable completion
                    retrieves the possible completions from the  value  of  the
                    COMPREPLY array variable.
            -G globpat
                    Expand  the  pathname expansion pattern globpat to generate
                    the possible completions.
            -P prefix
                    Add prefix to the beginning of each possible completion af-
                    ter all other options have been applied.
            -S suffix
                    Append suffix to each possible completion after  all  other
                    options have been applied.
            -W wordlist
                    Split  the wordlist using the characters in the IFS special
                    variable as delimiters, and  expand  each  resulting  word.
                    Shell  quoting is honored within wordlist, in order to pro-
                    vide a mechanism for the words to contain shell metacharac-
                    ters or characters in the value of IFS.  The possible  com-
                    pletions  are the members of the resultant list which match
                    a prefix of the word being completed.
            -X filterpat
                    filterpat is a pattern as used for pathname expansion.   It
                    is applied to the list of possible completions generated by
                    the  preceding  options  and arguments, and each completion
                    matching filterpat is removed from the list.  A  leading  !
                    in filterpat negates the pattern; in this case, any comple-
                    tion not matching filterpat is removed.

            The  return  value is true unless an invalid option is supplied, an
            option other than -p, -r, -D, -E, or -I is supplied without a  name
            argument,  an  attempt is made to remove a completion specification
            for a name for which no specification exists, or  an  error  occurs
            adding a completion specification.

     compopt [-o option] [-DEI] [+o option] [name]
            Modify  completion  options for each name according to the options,
            or for the currently-executing completion if no names are supplied.
            If no options are supplied, display the completion options for each
            name or the current completion.  The possible values of option  are
            those valid for the complete builtin described above.

            The -D option indicates that other supplied options should apply to
            the  "default"  command  completion;  the  -E option indicates that
            other supplied options should apply to "empty" command  completion;
            and  the -I option indicates that other supplied options should ap-
            ply to completion on the initial word on the line.  These  are  de-
            termined in the same way as the complete builtin.

            If  multiple  options  are supplied, the -D option takes precedence
            over -E, and both take precedence over -I.

            The return value is true unless an invalid option is  supplied,  an
            attempt  is made to modify the options for a name for which no com-
            pletion specification exists, or an output error occurs.

     continue [n]
            continue resumes the next iteration of the  enclosing  for,  while,
            until, or select loop.  If n is specified, bash resumes the nth en-
            closing  loop.  n must be >= 1.  If n is greater than the number of
            enclosing loops, the shell resumes the  last  enclosing  loop  (the
            "top-level"  loop).   The return value is 0 unless n is not greater
            than or equal to 1.

     declare [-aAfFgiIlnrtux] [-p] [name[=value] ...]
     typeset [-aAfFgiIlnrtux] [-p] [name[=value] ...]
            Declare variables and/or give them attributes.   If  no  names  are
            given  then  display  the values of variables or functions.  The -p
            option will display the attributes and values of each  name.   When
            -p  is  used with name arguments, additional options, other than -f
            and -F, are ignored.

            When -p is supplied without name arguments,  declare  will  display
            the  attributes  and  values of all variables having the attributes
            specified by the additional options.  If no other options are  sup-
            plied  with  -p,  declare will display the attributes and values of
            all shell variables.  The -f option restricts the display to  shell
            functions.

            The  -F  option  inhibits the display of function definitions; only
            the function name and attributes  are  printed.   If  the  extdebug
            shell  option is enabled using shopt, the source file name and line
            number where each name is defined are displayed as  well.   The  -F
            option implies -f.

            The  -g  option  forces  variables to be created or modified at the
            global scope, even when declare is executed in  a  shell  function.
            It is ignored when declare is not executed in a shell function.

            The -I option causes local variables to inherit the attributes (ex-
            cept the nameref attribute) and value of any existing variable with
            the  same  name  at  a  surrounding scope.  If there is no existing
            variable, the local variable is initially unset.

            The following options can be used to restrict output  to  variables
            with the specified attribute or to give variables attributes:
            -a     Each name is an indexed array variable (see Arrays above).
            -A     Each  name  is  an  associative  array  variable (see Arrays
                   above).
            -f     Each name refers to a shell function.
            -i     The variable is treated as an integer; arithmetic evaluation
                   (see ARITHMETIC EVALUATION  above)  is  performed  when  the
                   variable is assigned a value.
            -l     When  the variable is assigned a value, all upper-case char-
                   acters are converted  to  lower-case.   The  upper-case  at-
                   tribute is disabled.
            -n     Give  each name the nameref attribute, making it a name ref-
                   erence to another variable.  That other variable is  defined
                   by  the value of name.  All references, assignments, and at-
                   tribute modifications to name, except those using or  chang-
                   ing  the  -n attribute itself, are performed on the variable
                   referenced by name's value.  The nameref attribute cannot be
                   applied to array variables.
            -r     Make names readonly.  These names cannot  then  be  assigned
                   values by subsequent assignment statements or unset.
            -t     Give  each  name  the trace attribute.  Traced functions in-
                   herit the DEBUG and RETURN traps  from  the  calling  shell.
                   The trace attribute has no special meaning for variables.
            -u     When  the variable is assigned a value, all lower-case char-
                   acters are converted  to  upper-case.   The  lower-case  at-
                   tribute is disabled.
            -x     Mark each name for export to subsequent commands via the en-
                   vironment.

            Using "+" instead of "-" turns off the specified attribute instead,
            with the exceptions that +a and +A may not be used to destroy array
            variables and +r will not remove the readonly attribute.

            When  used in a function, declare and typeset make each name local,
            as with the local command, unless the -g option is supplied.  If  a
            variable  name  is followed by =value, the value of the variable is
            set to value.  When using -a or -A and the compound assignment syn-
            tax to create array variables, additional attributes  do  not  take
            effect until subsequent assignments.

            The  return  value is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered, an
            attempt is made to define a function using "-f foo=bar", an attempt
            is made to assign a value to a readonly  variable,  an  attempt  is
            made  to assign a value to an array variable without using the com-
            pound assignment syntax (see Arrays above), one of the names is not
            a valid shell variable name, an attempt is made to turn  off  read-
            only status for a readonly variable, an attempt is made to turn off
            array  status  for an array variable, or an attempt is made to dis-
            play a non-existent function with -f.

     dirs [-clpv] [+n] [-n]
            Without options, display the list of currently remembered  directo-
            ries.  The default display is on a single line with directory names
            separated  by  spaces.   Directories are added to the list with the
            pushd command; the popd command removes entries from the list.  The
            current directory is always the first directory in the stack.

            Options, if supplied, have the following meanings:
            -c     Clears the directory stack by deleting all of the entries.
            -l     Produces a listing using full pathnames; the default listing
                   format uses a tilde to denote the home directory.
            -p     Print the directory stack with one entry per line.
            -v     Print the directory stack with one entry per line, prefixing
                   each entry with its index in the stack.
            +n     Displays the nth entry counting from the left  of  the  list
                   shown  by  dirs  when invoked without options, starting with
                   zero.
            -n     Displays the nth entry counting from the right of  the  list
                   shown  by  dirs  when invoked without options, starting with
                   zero.

            The return value is 0 unless an invalid option is supplied or n in-
            dexes beyond the end of the directory stack.

     disown [-ar] [-h] [id ...]
            Without options, remove each id from  the  table  of  active  jobs.
            Each  id may be a job specification jobspec or a process ID pid; if
            id is a pid, disown uses the job containing pid as jobspec.

            If the -h option is supplied, disown does not remove the jobs  cor-
            responding to each id from the jobs table, but rather marks them so
            the  shell  does not send SIGHUP to the job if the shell receives a
            SIGHUP.

            If no id is supplied, the -a option means to  remove  or  mark  all
            jobs; the -r option without an id argument removes or marks running
            jobs.   If  no id is supplied, and neither the -a nor the -r option
            is supplied, disown removes or marks the current job.

            The return value is 0 unless an id does not specify a valid job.

     echo [-neE] [arg ...]
            Output the args, separated by spaces, followed by a  newline.   The
            return  status  is  0 unless a write error occurs.  If -n is speci-
            fied, the trailing newline is not printed.

            If the -e option is given, echo interprets the following backslash-
            escaped characters.  The -E option disables interpretation of these
            escape characters, even on systems where they  are  interpreted  by
            default.   The xpg_echo shell option determines whether or not echo
            interprets any options and expands these escape  characters.   echo
            does not interpret -- to mean the end of options.

            echo interprets the following escape sequences:
            \a     alert (bell)
            \b     backspace
            \c     suppress further output
            \e
            \E     an escape character
            \f     form feed
            \n     new line
            \r     carriage return
            \t     horizontal tab
            \v     vertical tab
            \\     backslash
            \0nnn  The  eight-bit  character whose value is the octal value nnn
                   (zero to three octal digits).
            \xHH   The eight-bit character whose value is the hexadecimal value
                   HH (one or two hex digits).
            \uHHHH
                   The Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) character  whose  value  is  the
                   hexadecimal value HHHH (one to four hex digits).
            \UHHHHHHHH
                   The  Unicode  (ISO/IEC  10646)  character whose value is the
                   hexadecimal value HHHHHHHH (one to eight hex digits).

            echo  writes  any  unrecognized  backslash-escaped  characters  un-
            changed.

     enable [-a] [-dnps] [-f filename] [name ...]
            Enable and disable builtin shell commands.  Disabling a builtin al-
            lows  an executable file which has the same name as a shell builtin
            to be executed without specifying a full pathname, even though  the
            shell normally searches for builtins before files.

            If  -n is supplied, each name is disabled; otherwise, names are en-
            abled.  For example, to use the test binary found  using  PATH  in-
            stead of the shell builtin version, run "enable -n test".

            If no name arguments are supplied, or if the -p option is supplied,
            print  a  list  of shell builtins.  With no other option arguments,
            the list consists of all enabled shell builtins.   If  -n  is  sup-
            plied,  print  only disabled builtins.  If -a is supplied, the list
            printed includes all builtins, with an indication of whether or not
            each is enabled.  The -s option means to restrict the output to the
            POSIX special builtins.

            The -f option means to load  the  new  builtin  command  name  from
            shared  object  filename,  on systems that support dynamic loading.
            If filename does not contain a slash, Bash will use  the  value  of
            the  BASH_LOADABLES_PATH  variable as a colon-separated list of di-
            rectories in  which  to  search  for  filename.   The  default  for
            BASH_LOADABLES_PATH  is  system-dependent,  and  may include "." to
            force a search of the current directory.  The -d option will delete
            a builtin previously loaded with -f.  If -s is used  with  -f,  the
            new builtin becomes a POSIX special builtin.

            If  no  options are supplied and a name is not a shell builtin, en-
            able will attempt to load name from a shared object named name,  as
            if the command were "enable -f name name".

            The return value is 0 unless a name is not a shell builtin or there
            is an error loading a new builtin from a shared object.

     eval [arg ...]
            Concatenate  the  args  together  into a single command, separating
            them with spaces.  Bash then reads and execute  this  command,  and
            returns its exit status as the return status of eval.  If there are
            no args, or only null arguments, eval returns 0.

     exec [-cl] [-a name] [command [arguments]]
            If  command  is specified, it replaces the shell without creating a
            new process.  command cannot be a shell builtin or  function.   The
            arguments  become  the  arguments  to command.  If the -l option is
            supplied, the shell places a dash at the beginning  of  the  zeroth
            argument  passed  to  command.  This is what login(1) does.  The -c
            option causes command to be executed with an empty environment.  If
            -a is supplied, the shell passes name as the zeroth argument to the
            executed command.

            If command cannot be executed for some  reason,  a  non-interactive
            shell  exits, unless the execfail shell option is enabled.  In that
            case, it returns a non-zero status.  An interactive shell returns a
            non-zero status if the file cannot be executed.  A  subshell  exits
            unconditionally if exec fails.

            If  command  is  not specified, any redirections take effect in the
            current shell, and the return status is 0.  If there is a  redirec-
            tion error, the return status is 1.

     exit [n]
            Cause  the  shell to exit with a status of n.  If n is omitted, the
            exit status is that of the last command executed.  Any trap on EXIT
            is executed before the shell terminates.

     export [-fn] [name[=value]] ...
     export -p [-f]
            The supplied names are marked for automatic export to the  environ-
            ment of subsequently executed commands.  If the -f option is given,
            the names refer to functions.

            The -n option unexports, or removes the export attribute, from each
            name.  If no names are given, or if only the -p option is supplied,
            export  displays  a  list of names of all exported variables on the
            standard output.  Using -p and -f together displays exported  func-
            tions.   The -p option displays output in a form that may be reused
            as input.

            export allows the value of a variable to be set when it is exported
            or unexported by following the variable  name  with  =value.   This
            sets  the value of the variable to value while modifying the export
            attribute.  export returns an exit status of 0  unless  an  invalid
            option  is encountered, one of the names is not a valid shell vari-
            able name, or -f is supplied with a name that is not a function.

     false  Does nothing; returns a non-zero status.

     fc [-e ename] [-lnr] [first] [last]
     fc -s [pat=rep] [cmd]
            The first form selects a range of commands from first to last  from
            the history list and displays or edits and re-executes them.  First
            and  last  may be specified as a string (to locate the last command
            beginning with that string) or as a number (an index into the  his-
            tory  list,  where  a negative number is used as an offset from the
            current command number).

            When listing, a first or last of 0 is equivalent to -1  and  -0  is
            equivalent  to the current command (usually the fc command); other-
            wise 0 is equivalent to -1 and -0 is invalid.  If last is not spec-
            ified, it is set to the current command for listing (so that "fc -l
            -10" prints the last 10 commands) and to first otherwise.  If first
            is not specified, it is set to the previous command for editing and
            -16 for listing.

            If the -l option is supplied, the commands are listed on the  stan-
            dard  output.   The  -n  option suppresses the command numbers when
            listing.  The -r option reverses the order of the commands.

            Otherwise, fc invokes the editor named by ename on a file  contain-
            ing those commands.  If ename is not supplied, fc uses the value of
            the  FCEDIT variable, and the value of EDITOR if FCEDIT is not set.
            If neither variable is set, fc uses vi. When editing  is  complete,
            fc reads the file containing the edited commands and echoes and ex-
            ecutes them.

            In the second form, fc re-executes command after replacing each in-
            stance  of  pat with rep.  Command is interpreted the same as first
            above.

            A useful alias to use with fc is "r="fc -s"", so that typing "r cc"
            runs the last command beginning with "cc" and  typing  "r"  re-exe-
            cutes the last command.

            If  the  first form is used, the return value is zero unless an in-
            valid option is encountered or first or last specify history  lines
            out  of  range.   When editing and re-executing a file of commands,
            the return value is the value of the last command executed or fail-
            ure if an error occurs with the temporary file.  If the second form
            is used, the return status is that of the re-executed command,  un-
            less  cmd  does not specify a valid history entry, in which case fc
            returns a non-zero status.

     fg [jobspec]
            Resume jobspec in the foreground, and make it the current job.   If
            jobspec  is  not present, fg uses the shell's notion of the current
            job.  The return value is that of the command placed into the fore-
            ground, or failure if run when job control is disabled or, when run
            with job control enabled, if jobspec does not specify a  valid  job
            or jobspec specifies a job that was started without job control.

     getopts optstring name [arg ...]
            getopts  is used by shell scripts and functions to parse positional
            parameters and obtain options and their arguments.  optstring  con-
            tains  the  option  characters  to be recognized; if a character is
            followed by a colon, the option is expected to  have  an  argument,
            which  should  be  separated from it by white space.  The colon and
            question mark characters may not be used as option characters.

            Each time it is invoked, getopts places  the  next  option  in  the
            shell  variable  name,  initializing name if it does not exist, and
            the index of the next argument to be processed  into  the  variable
            OPTIND.   OPTIND is initialized to 1 each time the shell or a shell
            script is invoked.  When an option requires  an  argument,  getopts
            places that argument into the variable OPTARG.

            The  shell does not reset OPTIND automatically; it must be manually
            reset between multiple calls to getopts within the same shell invo-
            cation to use a new set of parameters.

            When it reaches the end of options, getopts  exits  with  a  return
            value  greater  than zero.  OPTIND is set to the index of the first
            non-option argument, and name is set to ?.

            getopts normally parses the positional parameters, but if more  ar-
            guments are supplied as arg values, getopts parses those instead.

            getopts  can  report errors in two ways.  If the first character of
            optstring is a colon, getopts uses silent error reporting.  In nor-
            mal operation, getopts prints diagnostic messages when  it  encoun-
            ters  invalid options or missing option arguments.  If the variable
            OPTERR is set to 0, getopts does not display  any  error  messages,
            even if the first character of optstring is not a colon.

            If getopts detects an invalid option, it places ? into name and, if
            not  silent, prints an error message and unsets OPTARG.  If getopts
            is silent, it assigns the option character found to OPTARG and does
            not print a diagnostic message.

            If a required argument is not found, and getopts is not silent,  it
            sets  the  value of name to a question mark (?), unsets OPTARG, and
            prints a diagnostic message.  If getopts is  silent,  it  sets  the
            value  of name to a colon (:) and sets OPTARG to the option charac-
            ter found.

            getopts returns true if an option,  specified  or  unspecified,  is
            found.  It returns false if the end of options is encountered or an
            error occurs.

     hash [-lr] [-p filename] [-dt] [name]
            Each  time  hash  is invoked, it remembers the full pathname of the
            command name as determined by searching the directories  in  $PATH.
            Any  previously-remembered  pathname  associated  with name is dis-
            carded.  If the -p option is supplied, hash uses  filename  as  the
            full pathname of the command.

            The  -r option causes the shell to forget all remembered locations.
            Assigning to the PATH variable also clears  all  hashed  filenames.
            The -d option causes the shell to forget the remembered location of
            each name.

            If  the -t option is supplied, hash prints the full pathname corre-
            sponding to each name.  If multiple  name  arguments  are  supplied
            with  -t, hash prints the name before the corresponding hashed full
            pathname.  The -l option displays output in a format  that  may  be
            reused as input.

            If  no  arguments are given, or if only -l is supplied, hash prints
            information about remembered commands.  The -t, -d, and -p  options
            (the  options  that  act on the name arguments) are mutually exclu-
            sive.  Only one will be active.  If more than one is  supplied,  -t
            has higher priority than -p, and both have higher priority than -d.

            The  return status is zero unless a name is not found or an invalid
            option is supplied.

     help [-dms] [pattern]
            Display helpful information about builtin commands.  If pattern  is
            specified,  help  gives detailed help on all commands matching pat-
            tern as described below; otherwise it displays a list  of  all  the
            builtins and shell compound commands.

            Options, if supplied, have the follow meanings:

            -d     Display a short description of each pattern
            -m     Display  the  description  of each pattern in a manpage-like
                   format
            -s     Display only a short usage synopsis for each pattern

            If pattern contains pattern matching characters (see Pattern Match-
            ing above) it's treated as a shell pattern and help prints the  de-
            scription of each help topic matching pattern.

            If  not, and pattern exactly matches the name of a help topic, help
            prints the description associated with that topic.  Otherwise, help
            performs prefix matching and prints the descriptions of all  match-
            ing help topics.

            The return status is 0 unless no command matches pattern.

     history [n]
     history -c
     history -d offset
     history -d start-end
     history -anrw [filename]
     history -p arg [arg ...]
     history -s arg [arg ...]
            With  no  options,  display  the command history list with numbers.
            Entries prefixed with a * have been modified.   An  argument  of  n
            lists  only the last n entries.  If the shell variable HISTTIMEFOR-
            MAT is set and not null, it is used as a format  string  for  strf-
            time(3)  to  display  the time stamp associated with each displayed
            history entry.  If history uses HISTTIMEFORMAT, it does  not  print
            an  intervening space between the formatted time stamp and the his-
            tory entry.

            If filename is supplied, history uses it as the name of the history
            file; if not, it uses the value of HISTFILE.  If  filename  is  not
            supplied  and HISTFILE is unset or null, the -a, -n, -r, and -w op-
            tions have no effect.

            Options, if supplied, have the following meanings:
            -c     Clear the history list by deleting all  the  entries.   This
                   can  be  used  with the other options to replace the history
                   list.
            -d offset
                   Delete the history entry at position offset.  If  offset  is
                   negative,  it is interpreted as relative to one greater than
                   the last history position, so negative  indices  count  back
                   from  the  end  of the history, and an index of -1 refers to
                   the current history -d command.
            -d start-end
                   Delete the range of history entries between positions  start
                   and  end, inclusive.  Positive and negative values for start
                   and end are interpreted as described above.
            -a     Append the "new" history lines to the history  file.   These
                   are history lines entered since the beginning of the current
                   bash session, but not already appended to the history file.
            -n     Read  the  history  lines  not already read from the history
                   file and add them to the current history  list.   These  are
                   lines  appended  to  the history file since the beginning of
                   the current bash session.
            -r     Read the history file and append its contents to the current
                   history list.
            -w     Write the current history list to the  history  file,  over-
                   writing the history file.
            -p     Perform  history substitution on the following args and dis-
                   play the result on the standard output, without storing  the
                   results  in  the  history  list.  Each arg must be quoted to
                   disable normal history expansion.
            -s     Store the args in the history list as a single  entry.   The
                   last  command  in  the history list is removed before adding
                   the args.

            If the HISTTIMEFORMAT variable is  set,  history  writes  the  time
            stamp information associated with each history entry to the history
            file, marked with the history comment character as described above.
            When  the  history  file  is read, lines beginning with the history
            comment character followed immediately by a digit  are  interpreted
            as timestamps for the following history entry.

            The  return  value is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered, an
            error occurs while reading or writing the history file, an  invalid
            offset  or  range  is supplied as an argument to -d, or the history
            expansion supplied as an argument to -p fails.

     jobs [-lnprs] [ jobspec ... ]
     jobs -x command [ args ... ]
            The first form lists the active jobs.  The options have the follow-
            ing meanings:
            -l     List process IDs in addition to the normal information.
            -n     Display information only about jobs that have changed status
                   since the user was last notified of their status.
            -p     List only the process ID of the job's process group leader.
            -r     Display only running jobs.
            -s     Display only stopped jobs.

            If jobspec is supplied, jobs restricts output to information  about
            that  job.   The return status is 0 unless an invalid option is en-
            countered or an invalid jobspec is supplied.

            If the -x option is supplied, jobs replaces any  jobspec  found  in
            command  or  args with the corresponding process group ID, and exe-
            cutes command, passing it args, returning its exit status.

     kill [-s sigspec | -n signum | -sigspec] id [ ... ]
     kill -l|-L [sigspec | exit_status]
            Send the signal specified by sigspec or  signum  to  the  processes
            named  by each id.  Each id may be a job specification jobspec or a
            process ID pid.  sigspec is either a case-insensitive  signal  name
            such  as  SIGKILL (with or without the SIG prefix) or a signal num-
            ber; signum is a signal number.  If sigspec is not  supplied,  then
            kill sends SIGTERM.

            The  -l  option  lists the signal names.  If any arguments are sup-
            plied when -l is given, kill lists the names of the signals  corre-
            sponding  to  the  arguments,  and  the  return  status  is 0.  The
            exit_status argument to -l is a number specifying either  a  signal
            number  or  the exit status of a process terminated by a signal; if
            it is supplied, kill prints the name of the signal that caused  the
            process  to terminate.  kill assumes that process exit statuses are
            greater than 128; anything less than that is a signal number.   The
            -L option is equivalent to -l.

            kill  returns true if at least one signal was successfully sent, or
            false if an error occurs or an invalid option is encountered.

     let arg [arg ...]
            Each arg is evaluated as an arithmetic expression  (see  ARITHMETIC
            EVALUATION  above).  If the last arg evaluates to 0, let returns 1;
            otherwise let returns 0.

     local [option] [name[=value] ... | - ]
            For each argument, create a local variable named name and assign it
            value.  The option can be any of the options accepted  by  declare.
            When  local  is used within a function, it causes the variable name
            to have a visible scope restricted to that function and  its  chil-
            dren.  It is an error to use local when not within a function.

            If  name is -, it makes the set of shell options local to the func-
            tion in which local is invoked: any shell options changed using the
            set builtin inside the function after the call  to  local  are  re-
            stored to their original values when the function returns.  The re-
            store  is performed as if a series of set commands were executed to
            restore the values that were in place before the function.

            With no operands, local writes a list of  local  variables  to  the
            standard output.

            The  return status is 0 unless local is used outside a function, an
            invalid name is supplied, or name is a readonly variable.

     logout [n]
            Exit a login shell, returning a status of n to the shell's parent.

     mapfile [-d delim] [-n count] [-O origin] [-s count] [-t] [-u fd] [-C
     callback] [-c quantum] [array]
     readarray [-d delim] [-n count] [-O origin] [-s count] [-t] [-u fd] [-C
     callback] [-c quantum] [array]
            Read lines from the standard input, or from file descriptor  fd  if
            the  -u  option is supplied, into the indexed array variable array.
            The variable MAPFILE is the default array.  Options,  if  supplied,
            have the following meanings:
            -d     Use  the  first  character  of delim to terminate each input
                   line, rather than newline.  If delim is  the  empty  string,
                   mapfile will terminate a line when it reads a NUL character.
            -n     Copy at most count lines.  If count is 0, copy all lines.
            -O     Begin assigning to array at index origin.  The default index
                   is 0.
            -s     Discard the first count lines read.
            -t     Remove  a  trailing  delim  (default newline) from each line
                   read.
            -u     Read lines from file descriptor fd instead of  the  standard
                   input.
            -C     Evaluate  callback each time quantum lines are read.  The -c
                   option specifies quantum.
            -c     Specify the number of lines read between each call to  call-
                   back.

            If  -C  is specified without -c, the default quantum is 5000.  When
            callback is evaluated, it is supplied the index of the  next  array
            element  to be assigned and the line to be assigned to that element
            as additional arguments.  callback is evaluated after the  line  is
            read but before the array element is assigned.

            If  not  supplied with an explicit origin, mapfile will clear array
            before assigning to it.

            mapfile returns zero unless an invalid option or option argument is
            supplied, array is invalid or unassignable, or if array is  not  an
            indexed array.

     popd [-n] [+n] [-n]
            Remove entries from the directory stack.  The elements are numbered
            from  0  starting at the first directory listed by dirs, so popd is
            equivalent to "popd +0."  With no arguments, popd removes  the  top
            directory  from  the  stack,  and changes to the new top directory.
            Arguments, if supplied, have the following meanings:
            -n     Suppress the normal change of directory when removing direc-
                   tories from the stack, only manipulate the stack.
            +n     Remove the nth entry counting from  the  left  of  the  list
                   shown  by dirs, starting with zero, from the stack.  For ex-
                   ample: "popd +0" removes the first directory, "popd +1"  the
                   second.
            -n     Remove  the  nth  entry  counting from the right of the list
                   shown by dirs, starting with zero.  For example:  "popd  -0"
                   removes the last directory, "popd -1" the next to last.

            If  the  top element of the directory stack is modified, and the -n
            option was not supplied, popd uses the cd builtin to change to  the
            directory at the top of the stack.  If the cd fails, popd returns a
            non-zero value.

            Otherwise, popd returns false if an invalid option is supplied, the
            directory  stack  is empty, or n specifies a non-existent directory
            stack entry.

            If the popd command is successful, bash runs dirs to show the final
            contents of the directory stack, and the return status is 0.

     printf [-v var] format [arguments]
            Write the formatted arguments to the standard output under the con-
            trol of the format.  The -v option assigns the output to the  vari-
            able var rather than printing it to the standard output.

            The  format is a character string which contains three types of ob-
            jects: plain characters, which are simply copied to  standard  out-
            put,  character escape sequences, which are converted and copied to
            the standard output,  and  format  specifications,  each  of  which
            causes  printing  of  the next successive argument.  In addition to
            the  standard  printf(3)  format  characters   cCsSndiouxXeEfFgGaA,
            printf interprets the following additional format specifiers:
            %b     causes  printf  to  expand backslash escape sequences in the
                   corresponding argument in the same way as echo -e.
            %q     causes printf to output the corresponding argument in a for-
                   mat that can be reused as shell input.  %q and  %Q  use  the
                   $''  quoting  style if any characters in the argument string
                   require it, and backslash quoting otherwise.  If the  format
                   string  uses  the  printf  alternate form, these two formats
                   quote the argument string using single quotes.
            %Q     like %q, but applies any supplied precision to the  argument
                   before quoting it.
            %(datefmt)T
                   causes  printf to output the date-time string resulting from
                   using datefmt as a format string for strftime(3).  The  cor-
                   responding argument is an integer representing the number of
                   seconds  since  the epoch.  This format specifier recognizes
                   two special argument values: -1 represents the current time,
                   and -2 represents the time the shell was invoked.  If no ar-
                   gument is specified, conversion behaves as if  -1  had  been
                   supplied.   This  is an exception to the usual printf behav-
                   ior.

            The %b, %q, and %T format specifiers all use the  field  width  and
            precision  arguments  from  the format specification and write that
            many bytes from (or use that wide a field for) the  expanded  argu-
            ment, which usually contains more characters than the original.

            The  %n  format  specifier accepts a corresponding argument that is
            treated as a shell variable name.

            The %s and %c format specifiers accept an l (long) modifier,  which
            forces  them  to  convert  the  argument string to a wide-character
            string and apply any supplied field width and precision in terms of
            characters, not bytes.  The %S and %C format specifiers are equiva-
            lent to %ls and %lc, respectively.

            Arguments to non-string format specifiers are  treated  as  C  con-
            stants, except that a leading plus or minus sign is allowed, and if
            the leading character is a single or double quote, the value is the
            numeric value of the following character, using the current locale.

            The  format is reused as necessary to consume all of the arguments.
            If the format requires more arguments than are supplied, the  extra
            format  specifications behave as if a zero value or null string, as
            appropriate, had been supplied.  The return value is zero  on  suc-
            cess,  non-zero  if an invalid option is supplied or a write or as-
            signment error occurs.

     pushd [-n] [+n] [-n]
     pushd [-n] [dir]
            Add a directory to the top of the directory stack,  or  rotate  the
            stack,  making  the new top of the stack the current working direc-
            tory.  With no arguments, pushd exchanges the top two  elements  of
            the  directory  stack.   Arguments, if supplied, have the following
            meanings:
            -n     Suppress the normal change of  directory  when  rotating  or
                   adding directories to the stack, only manipulate the stack.
            +n     Rotate  the  stack  so that the nth directory (counting from
                   the left of the list shown by dirs, starting with  zero)  is
                   at the top.
            -n     Rotates  the  stack so that the nth directory (counting from
                   the right of the list shown by dirs, starting with zero)  is
                   at the top.
            dir    Adds dir to the directory stack at the top.

            After  the  stack  has been modified, if the -n option was not sup-
            plied, pushd uses the cd builtin to change to the directory at  the
            top of the stack.  If the cd fails, pushd returns a non-zero value.

            Otherwise,  if no arguments are supplied, pushd returns zero unless
            the directory stack is empty.  When rotating the  directory  stack,
            pushd  returns zero unless the directory stack is empty or n speci-
            fies a non-existent directory stack element.

            If the pushd command is successful, bash runs dirs to show the  fi-
            nal contents of the directory stack.

     pwd [-LP]
            Print  the absolute pathname of the current working directory.  The
            pathname printed contains no symbolic links if  the  -P  option  is
            supplied  or  the  -o physical option to the set builtin command is
            enabled.  If the -L option is used, the pathname printed  may  con-
            tain symbolic links.  The return status is 0 unless an error occurs
            while  reading  the name of the current directory or an invalid op-
            tion is supplied.

     read [-Eers] [-a aname] [-d delim] [-i text] [-n nchars] [-N nchars] [-p
     prompt] [-t timeout] [-u fd] [name ...]
            Read one line from the standard input, or from the file  descriptor
            fd supplied as an argument to the -u option, split it into words as
            described  above under Word Splitting, and assign the first word to
            the first name, the second word to the second name, and so on.   If
            there  are more words than names, the remaining words and their in-
            tervening delimiters are assigned to the last name.  If  there  are
            fewer  words  read  from the input stream than names, the remaining
            names are assigned empty values.  The characters in  the  value  of
            the  IFS  variable  are used to split the line into words using the
            same rules the shell uses for expansion (described above under Word
            Splitting).  The backslash character (\) removes any special  mean-
            ing for the next character read and is used for line continuation.

            Options, if supplied, have the following meanings:
            -a aname
                   The  words  are  assigned to sequential indices of the array
                   variable aname, starting at 0.  aname is  unset  before  any
                   new values are assigned.  Other name arguments are ignored.
            -d delim
                   The  first  character  of  delim  terminates the input line,
                   rather than newline.  If delim is  the  empty  string,  read
                   will terminate a line when it reads a NUL character.
            -e     If  the  standard input is coming from a terminal, read uses
                   readline (see READLINE above) to obtain the line.   Readline
                   uses the current (or default, if line editing was not previ-
                   ously  active) editing settings, but uses readline's default
                   filename completion.
            -E     If the standard input is coming from a terminal,  read  uses
                   readline  (see READLINE above) to obtain the line.  Readline
                   uses the current (or default, if line editing was not previ-
                   ously active) editing settings, but uses bash's default com-
                   pletion, including programmable completion.
            -i text
                   If readline is being used to read the line, read places text
                   into the editing buffer before editing begins.
            -n nchars
                   read returns after reading  nchars  characters  rather  than
                   waiting  for  a complete line of input, unless it encounters
                   EOF or read times out, but honors a delimiter  if  it  reads
                   fewer than nchars characters before the delimiter.
            -N nchars
                   read  returns after reading exactly nchars characters rather
                   than waiting for a complete line of input, unless it encoun-
                   ters EOF or read times out.  Any delimiter characters in the
                   input are not treated specially and do not cause read to re-
                   turn until it has read nchars characters.  The result is not
                   split on the characters in IFS; the intent is that the vari-
                   able is assigned exactly the characters read (with  the  ex-
                   ception of backslash; see the -r option below).
            -p prompt
                   Display  prompt  on  standard error, without a trailing new-
                   line, before attempting to read any input, but only if input
                   is coming from a terminal.
            -r     Backslash does not act as an escape  character.   The  back-
                   slash  is considered to be part of the line.  In particular,
                   a backslash-newline pair may not then be used as a line con-
                   tinuation.
            -s     Silent mode.  If input is coming from a terminal, characters
                   are not echoed.
            -t timeout
                   Cause read to time out and return failure  if  it  does  not
                   read  a  complete  line  of  input (or a specified number of
                   characters) within timeout seconds.  timeout may be a  deci-
                   mal  number  with a fractional portion following the decimal
                   point.  This option is only effective if read is reading in-
                   put from a terminal, pipe, or other special file; it has  no
                   effect  when reading from regular files.  If read times out,
                   it saves any partial input read into the specified  variable
                   name,  and  the exit status is greater than 128.  If timeout
                   is 0, read returns immediately, without trying to  read  any
                   data.  In this case, the exit status is 0 if input is avail-
                   able  on the specified file descriptor, or the read will re-
                   turn EOF, non-zero otherwise.
            -u fd  Read input from file descriptor fd instead of  the  standard
                   input.

            Other  than  the case where delim is the empty string, read ignores
            any NUL characters in the input.

            If no names are supplied, read assigns the line read,  without  the
            ending delimiter but otherwise unmodified, to the variable REPLY.

            The  exit  status  is zero, unless end-of-file is encountered, read
            times out (in which case the status is greater than 128),  a  vari-
            able  assignment  error  (such as assigning to a readonly variable)
            occurs, or an invalid file descriptor is supplied as  the  argument
            to -u.

     readonly [-aAf] [-p] [name[=word] ...]
            The  given names are marked readonly; the values of these names may
            not be changed by subsequent assignment or unset.  If the -f option
            is supplied, each name refers to a shell function.  The  -a  option
            restricts  the variables to indexed arrays; the -A option restricts
            the variables to associative arrays.  If both options are supplied,
            -A takes precedence.  If no name arguments are supplied, or if  the
            -p  option  is  supplied,  print a list of all readonly names.  The
            other options may be used to restrict the output to a subset of the
            set of readonly names.  The -p option displays output in  a  format
            that may be reused as input.

            readonly  allows the value of a variable to be set at the same time
            the readonly attribute is changed by following  the  variable  name
            with =value.  This sets the value of the variable is to value while
            modifying the readonly attribute.

            The return status is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered, one
            of  the names is not a valid shell variable name, or -f is supplied
            with a name that is not a function.

     return [n]
            Stop executing a shell function or  sourced  file  and  return  the
            value  specified  by  n to its caller.  If n is omitted, the return
            status is that of the last command executed.  If return is executed
            by a trap handler, the last command used to determine the status is
            the last command executed before the trap handler.   If  return  is
            executed  during  a  DEBUG trap, the last command used to determine
            the status is the last command executed by the trap handler  before
            return was invoked.

            When  return  is used to terminate execution of a script being exe-
            cuted by the .  (source) command, it causes the shell to stop  exe-
            cuting  that  script  and return either n or the exit status of the
            last command executed within the script as the exit status  of  the
            script.   If  n is supplied, the return value is its least signifi-
            cant 8 bits.

            Any command associated with the RETURN trap is executed before exe-
            cution resumes after the function or script.

            The return status is non-zero if return is supplied  a  non-numeric
            argument, or is used outside a function and not during execution of
            a script by . or source.

     set [-abefhkmnptuvxBCEHPT] [-o option-name] [--] [-] [arg ...]
     set [+abefhkmnptuvxBCEHPT] [+o option-name] [--] [-] [arg ...]
     set -o
     set +o
            Without  options, display the name and value of each shell variable
            in a format that can be reused as input for  setting  or  resetting
            the  currently-set variables.  Read-only variables cannot be reset.
            In posix mode, only shell variables  are  listed.   The  output  is
            sorted  according  to  the current locale.  When options are speci-
            fied, they set or unset shell attributes.  Any arguments  remaining
            after  option  processing  are treated as values for the positional
            parameters and are assigned, in order, to $1,  $2,  ...,  $n.   Op-
            tions, if specified, have the following meanings:
            -a      Each  variable  or  function that is created or modified is
                    given the export attribute and marked for export to the en-
                    vironment of subsequent commands.
            -b      Report the status of  terminated  background  jobs  immedi-
                    ately,  rather than before the next primary prompt or after
                    a foreground command terminates.  This  is  effective  only
                    when job control is enabled.
            -e      Exit immediately if a pipeline (which may consist of a sin-
                    gle  simple  command),  a  list, or a compound command (see
                    SHELL GRAMMAR above), exits with a  non-zero  status.   The
                    shell  does  not  exit if the command that fails is part of
                    the command list immediately following a while or until re-
                    served word, part of the test following the if or elif  re-
                    served  words,  part  of any command executed in a && or ||
                    list except the command following the final && or  ||,  any
                    command in a pipeline but the last (subject to the state of
                    the  pipefail  shell  option),  or  if the command's return
                    value is being inverted with  !.   If  a  compound  command
                    other  than  a subshell returns a non-zero status because a
                    command failed while -e was being ignored, the  shell  does
                    not  exit.   A  trap on ERR, if set, is executed before the
                    shell exits.  This option applies to the shell  environment
                    and  each subshell environment separately (see COMMAND EXE-
                    CUTION ENVIRONMENT above), and may cause subshells to  exit
                    before executing all the commands in the subshell.

                    If  a compound command or shell function executes in a con-
                    text where -e is being ignored, none of the  commands  exe-
                    cuted  within the compound command or function body will be
                    affected by the -e setting, even if -e is set and a command
                    returns a failure status.  If a compound command  or  shell
                    function  sets  -e while executing in a context where -e is
                    ignored, that setting will not have any  effect  until  the
                    compound  command  or  the  command containing the function
                    call completes.
            -f      Disable pathname expansion.
            -h      Remember the location of commands as they are looked up for
                    execution.  This is enabled by default.
            -k      All arguments in the  form  of  assignment  statements  are
                    placed  in  the  environment  for a command, not just those
                    that precede the command name.
            -m      Monitor mode.  Job control is enabled.  This option  is  on
                    by  default  for interactive shells on systems that support
                    it (see JOB CONTROL above).  All processes run in  a  sepa-
                    rate  process  group.  When a background job completes, the
                    shell prints a line containing its exit status.
            -n      Read commands but do not execute them.  This may be used to
                    check a shell script for syntax errors.  This is ignored by
                    interactive shells.
            -o option-name
                    The option-name can be one of the following:
                    allexport
                            Same as -a.
                    braceexpand
                            Same as -B.
                    emacs   Use an emacs-style command line editing  interface.
                            This is enabled by default when the shell is inter-
                            active,  unless  the  shell  is  started  with  the
                            --noediting option.  This also affects the  editing
                            interface used for read -e.
                    errexit
                            Same as -e.
                    errtrace
                            Same as -E.
                    functrace
                            Same as -T.
                    hashall
                            Same as -h.
                    histexpand
                            Same as -H.
                    history
                            Enable  command  history,  as described above under
                            HISTORY.  This option is on by default in  interac-
                            tive shells.
                    ignoreeof
                            The   effect   is   as   if   the   shell   command
                            "IGNOREEOF=10" had been executed (see  Shell  Vari-
                            ables above).
                    keyword
                            Same as -k.
                    monitor
                            Same as -m.

                            Same as -C.
                    noexec  Same as -n.
                    noglob  Same as -f.
                    nolog   Currently ignored.
                    notify  Same as -b.
                    nounset
                            Same as -u.
                    onecmd  Same as -t.
                    physical
                            Same as -P.
                    pipefail
                            If set, the return value of a pipeline is the value
                            of the last (rightmost) command to exit with a non-
                            zero  status,  or  zero  if  all  commands  in  the
                            pipeline exit successfully.  This  option  is  dis-
                            abled by default.
                    posix   Enable  posix  mode;  change  the  behavior of bash
                            where the default operation differs from the  POSIX
                            standard to match the standard.  See SEE ALSO below
                            for  a  reference  to  a  document that details how
                            posix mode affects bash's behavior.
                    privileged
                            Same as -p.
                    verbose
                            Same as -v.
                    vi      Use a  vi-style  command  line  editing  interface.
                            This  also  affects  the editing interface used for
                            read -e.
                    xtrace  Same as -x.
                    If -o is supplied with no option-name, set prints the  cur-
                    rent  shell option settings.  If +o is supplied with no op-
                    tion-name, set prints a series of set commands to  recreate
                    the current option settings on the standard output.
            -p      Turn  on privileged mode.  In this mode, the shell does not
                    read the $ENV and $BASH_ENV files, shell functions are  not
                    inherited   from   the   environment,  and  the  SHELLOPTS,
                    BASHOPTS, CDPATH, and GLOBIGNORE variables, if they  appear
                    in  the  environment, are ignored.  If the shell is started
                    with the effective user (group) id not equal  to  the  real
                    user  (group)  id, and the -p option is not supplied, these
                    actions are taken and the effective user id is set  to  the
                    real user id.  If the -p option is supplied at startup, the
                    effective  user  id  is not reset.  Turning this option off
                    causes the effective user and group ids to be  set  to  the
                    real user and group ids.
            -r      Enable  restricted shell mode.  This option cannot be unset
                    once it has been set.
            -t      Exit after reading and executing one command.
            -u      Treat unset variables and parameters other than the special
                    parameters "@" and "*", or array variables subscripted with
                    "@" or "*", as an error when  performing  parameter  expan-
                    sion.   If  expansion  is attempted on an unset variable or
                    parameter, the shell prints an error message, and,  if  not
                    interactive, exits with a non-zero status.
            -v      Print shell input lines as they are read.
            -x      After expanding each simple command, for command, case com-
                    mand,  select  command,  or arithmetic for command, display
                    the expanded value of PS4, followed by the command and  its
                    expanded arguments or associated word list, to the standard
                    error.
            -B      The  shell  performs  brace  expansion (see Brace Expansion
                    above).  This is on by default.
            -C      If set, bash does not overwrite an existing file  with  the
                    >, >&, and <> redirection operators.  Using the redirection
                    operator  >|  instead of > will override this and force the
                    creation of an output file.
            -E      If set, any trap on ERR is inherited  by  shell  functions,
                    command  substitutions, and commands executed in a subshell
                    environment.  The ERR trap is  normally  not  inherited  in
                    such cases.
            -H      Enable !  style history substitution.  This option is on by
                    default when the shell is interactive.
            -P      If set, the shell does not resolve symbolic links when exe-
                    cuting  commands such as cd that change the current working
                    directory.  It uses the physical  directory  structure  in-
                    stead.   By  default, bash follows the logical chain of di-
                    rectories when performing commands which change the current
                    directory.
            -T      If set, any traps on DEBUG  and  RETURN  are  inherited  by
                    shell  functions,  command substitutions, and commands exe-
                    cuted in a subshell  environment.   The  DEBUG  and  RETURN
                    traps are normally not inherited in such cases.
            --      If  no  arguments  follow this option, unset the positional
                    parameters.  Otherwise, set the  positional  parameters  to
                    the args, even if some of them begin with a -.
            -       Signal the end of options, and assign all remaining args to
                    the  positional  parameters.   The  -x  and  -v options are
                    turned off.  If there are no args, the  positional  parame-
                    ters remain unchanged.

            The  options  are  off  by default unless otherwise noted.  Using +
            rather than - causes these options to be turned off.   The  options
            can  also  be specified as arguments to an invocation of the shell.
            The current set of options may be found in $-.  The  return  status
            is always zero unless an invalid option is encountered.

     shift [n]
            Rename  positional  parameters  from n+1 ... to $1 ....  Parameters
            represented by the numbers $# down to $#-n+1 are unset.  n must  be
            a  non-negative number less than or equal to $#.  If n is 0, no pa-
            rameters are changed.  If n is not given, it is assumed  to  be  1.
            If n is greater than $#, the positional parameters are not changed.
            The  return  status is greater than zero if n is greater than $# or
            less than zero; otherwise 0.

     shopt [-pqsu] [-o] [optname ...]
            Toggle the values of settings controlling optional shell  behavior.
            The settings can be either those listed below, or, if the -o option
            is used, those available with the -o option to the set builtin com-
            mand.

            With  no options, or with the -p option, display a list of all set-
            table options, with an indication of whether or not each is set; if
            any optnames are supplied, the output is restricted  to  those  op-
            tions.   The -p option displays output in a form that may be reused
            as input.

            Other options have the following meanings:
            -s     Enable (set) each optname.
            -u     Disable (unset) each optname.
            -q     Suppresses normal output (quiet mode); the return status in-
                   dicates whether the optname is set or  unset.   If  multiple
                   optname arguments are supplied with -q, the return status is
                   zero if all optnames are enabled; non-zero otherwise.
            -o     Restricts  the values of optname to be those defined for the
                   -o option to the set builtin.

            If either -s or -u is used with no optname arguments,  shopt  shows
            only  those  options  which are set or unset, respectively.  Unless
            otherwise noted, the shopt options are disabled (unset) by default.

            The return status when listing options is zero if all optnames  are
            enabled,  non-zero  otherwise.   When setting or unsetting options,
            the return status is zero unless an optname is not  a  valid  shell
            option.

            The list of shopt options is:

            array_expand_once
                    If  set,  the shell suppresses multiple evaluation of asso-
                    ciative and indexed array subscripts during arithmetic  ex-
                    pression evaluation, while executing builtins that can per-
                    form  variable  assignments,  and  while executing builtins
                    that perform array dereferencing.
            assoc_expand_once
                    Deprecated; a synonym for array_expand_once.
            autocd  If set, a command name that is the name of a  directory  is
                    executed  as  if  it  were  the argument to the cd command.
                    This option is only used by interactive shells.
            bash_source_fullpath
                    If set, filenames added to the BASH_SOURCE  array  variable
                    are  converted  to  full  pathnames  (see  Shell  Variables
                    above).
            cdable_vars
                    If set, an argument to the cd builtin command that is not a
                    directory is assumed to be the name  of  a  variable  whose
                    value is the directory to change to.
            cdspell
                    If  set, the cd command attempts to correct minor errors in
                    the spelling of a directory component.   Minor  errors  in-
                    clude  transposed  characters, a missing character, and one
                    extra character.  If cd corrects  the  directory  name,  it
                    prints  the  corrected  filename, and the command proceeds.
                    This option is only used by interactive shells.
            checkhash
                    If set, bash checks that a command found in the hash  table
                    exists before trying to execute it.  If a hashed command no
                    longer exists, bash performs a normal path search.
            checkjobs
                    If  set,  bash  lists the status of any stopped and running
                    jobs before exiting an interactive shell.  If any jobs  are
                    running,  bash  defers  the exit until a second exit is at-
                    tempted without an intervening  command  (see  JOB  CONTROL
                    above).  The shell always postpones exiting if any jobs are
                    stopped.
            checkwinsize
                    If  set,  bash  checks  the window size after each external
                    (non-builtin) command and, if necessary, updates the values
                    of LINES and COLUMNS, using the file descriptor  associated
                    with  the  standard error if it is a terminal.  This option
                    is enabled by default.
            cmdhist
                    If set, bash attempts to save all lines of a  multiple-line
                    command  in  the  same history entry.  This allows easy re-
                    editing of multi-line commands.  This option is enabled  by
                    default,  but  only has an effect if command history is en-
                    abled, as described above under HISTORY.
            compat31
            compat32
            compat40
            compat41
            compat42
            compat43
            compat44
                    These control aspects of  the  shell's  compatibility  mode
                    (see SHELL COMPATIBILITY MODE below).
            complete_fullquote
                    If  set,  bash quotes all shell metacharacters in filenames
                    and directory names when  performing  completion.   If  not
                    set,  bash  removes  metacharacters such as the dollar sign
                    from the set of characters that will be quoted in completed
                    filenames when these metacharacters appear in  shell  vari-
                    able  references in words to be completed.  This means that
                    dollar signs in variable names that expand  to  directories
                    will  not be quoted; however, any dollar signs appearing in
                    filenames will not be quoted, either.  This is active  only
                    when  bash  is  using  backslashes to quote completed file-
                    names.  This variable is set by default, which is  the  de-
                    fault bash behavior in versions through 4.2.
            direxpand
                    If  set,  bash replaces directory names with the results of
                    word expansion when performing filename  completion.   This
                    changes  the  contents  of the readline editing buffer.  If
                    not set, bash attempts to preserve what the user typed.
            dirspell
                    If set, bash  attempts  spelling  correction  on  directory
                    names  during  word  completion  if the directory name ini-
                    tially supplied does not exist.
            dotglob
                    If set, bash includes filenames beginning with a "." in the
                    results of pathname expansion.  The filenames . and .. must
                    always be matched explicitly, even if dotglob is set.
            execfail
                    If set, a non-interactive shell will not exit if it  cannot
                    execute  the  file  specified  as  an  argument to the exec
                    builtin.  An interactive shell does not exit if exec fails.
            expand_aliases
                    If set, aliases  are  expanded  as  described  above  under
                    ALIASES.  This option is enabled by default for interactive
                    shells.
            extdebug
                    If  set  at  shell  invocation, or in a shell startup file,
                    arrange to execute the debugger profile  before  the  shell
                    starts,  identical  to the --debugger option.  If set after
                    invocation, behavior intended for use by debuggers  is  en-
                    abled:
                    1.     The  -F  option  to the declare builtin displays the
                           source file name and line  number  corresponding  to
                           each function name supplied as an argument.
                    2.     If  the command run by the DEBUG trap returns a non-
                           zero value, the next command is skipped and not exe-
                           cuted.
                    3.     If the command run by the DEBUG trap returns a value
                           of 2, and the shell is executing in a subroutine  (a
                           shell  function  or a shell script executed by the .
                           or source builtins), the shell simulates a  call  to
                           return.
                    4.     BASH_ARGC  and BASH_ARGV are updated as described in
                           their descriptions above).
                    5.     Function tracing is enabled:  command  substitution,
                           shell  functions,  and subshells invoked with ( com-
                           mand ) inherit the DEBUG and RETURN traps.
                    6.     Error  tracing  is  enabled:  command  substitution,
                           shell  functions,  and subshells invoked with ( com-
                           mand ) inherit the ERR trap.
            extglob
                    If set, enable the extended pattern matching  features  de-
                    scribed above under Pathname Expansion.
            extquote
                    If set, $'string' and $"string" quoting is performed within
                    ${parameter}  expansions  enclosed  in double quotes.  This
                    option is enabled by default.
            failglob
                    If set, patterns which fail to match filenames during path-
                    name expansion result in an expansion error.
            force_fignore
                    If set, the suffixes specified by the FIGNORE  shell  vari-
                    able cause words to be ignored when performing word comple-
                    tion  even  if the ignored words are the only possible com-
                    pletions.  See Shell Variables above for a  description  of
                    FIGNORE.  This option is enabled by default.
            globasciiranges
                    If  set, range expressions used in pattern matching bracket
                    expressions (see Pattern Matching above) behave  as  if  in
                    the traditional C locale when performing comparisons.  That
                    is,  pattern  matching  does  not take the current locale's
                    collating sequence into account, so b will not collate  be-
                    tween  A and B, and upper-case and lower-case ASCII charac-
                    ters will collate together.
            globskipdots
                    If set, pathname expansion will never match the filenames .
                    and .., even if the pattern begins with a ".".  This option
                    is enabled by default.
            globstar
                    If set, the pattern ** used in a pathname expansion context
                    will match all files and zero or more directories and  sub-
                    directories.   If  the pattern is followed by a /, only di-
                    rectories and subdirectories match.
            gnu_errfmt
                    If set, shell error messages are written  in  the  standard
                    GNU error message format.
            histappend
                    If  set,  the history list is appended to the file named by
                    the value of the HISTFILE variable when  the  shell  exits,
                    rather than overwriting the file.
            histreedit
                    If  set,  and readline is being used, the user is given the
                    opportunity to re-edit a failed history substitution.
            histverify
                    If set, and readline is being used, the results of  history
                    substitution  are  not  immediately  passed  to  the  shell
                    parser.  Instead, the resulting line  is  loaded  into  the
                    readline editing buffer, allowing further modification.
            hostcomplete
                    If  set,  and  readline is being used, bash will attempt to
                    perform hostname completion when a word containing a  @  is
                    being  completed  (see  Completing  under  READLINE above).
                    This is enabled by default.
            huponexit
                    If set, bash will send SIGHUP to all jobs when an  interac-
                    tive login shell exits.
            inherit_errexit
                    If  set, command substitution inherits the value of the er-
                    rexit option, instead of unsetting it in the subshell envi-
                    ronment.  This option is enabled when  posix  mode  is  en-
                    abled.
            interactive_comments
                    In  an  interactive  shell,  a word beginning with # causes
                    that word and all remaining characters on that line  to  be
                    ignored,  as  in  a  non-interactive  shell  (see  COMMENTS
                    above).  This option is enabled by default.
            lastpipe
                    If set, and job control is not active, the shell  runs  the
                    last  command  of a pipeline not executed in the background
                    in the current shell environment.
            lithist
                    If set, and the cmdhist option is enabled, multi-line  com-
                    mands  are  saved  to  the  history  with embedded newlines
                    rather than using semicolon separators where possible.
            localvar_inherit
                    If set, local variables inherit the value and attributes of
                    a variable of the same name that exists at a previous scope
                    before any new value is assigned.  The nameref attribute is
                    not inherited.
            localvar_unset
                    If set, calling unset on local variables in previous  func-
                    tion  scopes marks them so subsequent lookups find them un-
                    set until that function returns.  This is identical to  the
                    behavior  of unsetting local variables at the current func-
                    tion scope.
            login_shell
                    The shell sets this option if it  is  started  as  a  login
                    shell  (see  INVOCATION  above).   The  value  may  not  be
                    changed.
            mailwarn
                    If set, and a file that bash is checking for mail has  been
                    accessed  since the last time it was checked, bash displays
                    the message "The mail in mailfile has been read".
            no_empty_cmd_completion
                    If set, and readline is being used, bash  does  not  search
                    PATH  for possible completions when completion is attempted
                    on an empty line.
            nocaseglob
                    If set, bash matches filenames in a case-insensitive  fash-
                    ion when performing pathname expansion (see Pathname Expan-
                    sion above).
            nocasematch
                    If set, bash matches patterns in a case-insensitive fashion
                    when  performing matching while executing case or [[ condi-
                    tional commands, when performing pattern substitution  word
                    expansions,  or when filtering possible completions as part
                    of programmable completion.
            noexpand_translation
                    If set, bash encloses  the  translated  results  of  $"..."
                    quoting  in single quotes instead of double quotes.  If the
                    string is not translated, this has no effect.
            nullglob
                    If set, pathname expansion patterns which  match  no  files
                    (see  Pathname  Expansion  above) expand to nothing and are
                    removed, rather than expanding to themselves.
            patsub_replacement
                    If set, bash expands occurrences of &  in  the  replacement
                    string  of  pattern substitution to the text matched by the
                    pattern, as  described  under  Parameter  Expansion  above.
                    This option is enabled by default.
            progcomp
                    If  set, enable the programmable completion facilities (see
                    Programmable Completion above).  This option is enabled  by
                    default.
            progcomp_alias
                    If set, and programmable completion is enabled, bash treats
                    a  command name that doesn't have any completions as a pos-
                    sible alias and attempts alias expansion.   If  it  has  an
                    alias, bash attempts programmable completion using the com-
                    mand word resulting from the expanded alias.
            promptvars
                    If set, prompt strings undergo parameter expansion, command
                    substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal after
                    being  expanded  as described in PROMPTING above.  This op-
                    tion is enabled by default.
            restricted_shell
                    The shell sets this option if it is started  in  restricted
                    mode  (see  RESTRICTED  SHELL below).  The value may not be
                    changed.  This is not reset when the startup files are exe-
                    cuted, allowing the startup files to  discover  whether  or
                    not a shell is restricted.
            shift_verbose
                    If  set, the shift builtin prints an error message when the
                    shift count exceeds the number of positional parameters.
            sourcepath
                    If set, the . (source) builtin uses the value  of  PATH  to
                    find the directory containing the file supplied as an argu-
                    ment  when  the  -p option is not supplied.  This option is
                    enabled by default.
            varredir_close
                    If set, the shell automatically closes file descriptors as-
                    signed using the {varname} redirection syntax (see REDIREC-
                    TION above) instead of leaving them open when  the  command
                    completes.
            xpg_echo
                    If set, the echo builtin expands backslash-escape sequences
                    by  default.   If  the  posix shell option is also enabled,
                    echo does not interpret any options.

     suspend [-f]
            Suspend the execution of this shell until  it  receives  a  SIGCONT
            signal.   A  login  shell,  or a shell without job control enabled,
            cannot be suspended; the -f option will override this and force the
            suspension.  The return status is 0 unless the  shell  is  a  login
            shell or job control is not enabled and -f is not supplied.

     test expr
     [ expr ]
            Return  a  status of 0 (true) or 1 (false) depending on the evalua-
            tion of the conditional expression expr.  Each operator and operand
            must be a separate argument.  Expressions are composed of the  pri-
            maries  described  above  under CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS.  test does
            not accept any options, nor does it accept and ignore  an  argument
            of -- as signifying the end of options.

            Expressions  may  be combined using the following operators, listed
            in decreasing order of precedence.  The evaluation depends  on  the
            number of arguments; see below.  test uses operator precedence when
            there are five or more arguments.
            ! expr
                   True if expr is false.
            ( expr )
                   Returns  the  value  of  expr.  This may be used to override
                   normal operator precedence.
            expr1 -a expr2
                   True if both expr1 and expr2 are true.
            expr1 -o expr2
                   True if either expr1 or expr2 is true.

            test and [ evaluate conditional expressions using a  set  of  rules
            based on the number of arguments.

            0 arguments
                   The expression is false.
            1 argument
                   The  expression  is  true if and only if the argument is not
                   null.
            2 arguments
                   If the first argument is !, the expression is  true  if  and
                   only  if the second argument is null.  If the first argument
                   is one of the unary conditional operators listed above under
                   CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS, the expression is true if the unary
                   test is true.  If the first argument is not  a  valid  unary
                   conditional operator, the expression is false.
            3 arguments
                   The  following  conditions  are applied in the order listed.
                   If the second argument is one of the binary conditional  op-
                   erators  listed above under CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS, the re-
                   sult of the expression is the result of the binary test  us-
                   ing  the  first and third arguments as operands.  The -a and
                   -o operators are considered binary operators when there  are
                   three  arguments.   If the first argument is !, the value is
                   the negation of the two-argument test using the  second  and
                   third arguments.  If the first argument is exactly ( and the
                   third  argument is exactly ), the result is the one-argument
                   test of the second argument.  Otherwise, the  expression  is
                   false.
            4 arguments
                   The  following  conditions  are applied in the order listed.
                   If the first argument is !, the result is  the  negation  of
                   the  three-argument expression composed of the remaining ar-
                   guments.  If the first argument is exactly ( and the  fourth
                   argument  is  exactly ), the result is the two-argument test
                   of the second and third arguments.  Otherwise,  the  expres-
                   sion  is  parsed and evaluated according to precedence using
                   the rules listed above.
            5 or more arguments
                   The expression is parsed and evaluated according  to  prece-
                   dence using the rules listed above.

            When  the  shell  is in posix mode, or if the expression is part of
            the [[ command, the < and > operators sort using  the  current  lo-
            cale.   If  the shell is not in posix mode, the test and [ commands
            sort lexicographically using ASCII ordering.

            The historical operator-precedence parsing with 4 or more arguments
            can lead to ambiguities when it encounters strings that  look  like
            primaries.   The  POSIX  standard has deprecated the -a and -o pri-
            maries  and  enclosing  expressions  within  parentheses.   Scripts
            should  no  longer  use  them.  It's much more reliable to restrict
            test invocations to a single primary, and to replace uses of -a and
            -o with the shell's && and || list operators.

     times  Print the accumulated user and system times for the shell  and  for
            processes run from the shell.  The return status is 0.

     trap [-lpP] [[action] sigspec ...]
            The  action  is  a command that is read and executed when the shell
            receives any of the signals sigspec.   If  action  is  absent  (and
            there is a single sigspec) or -, each specified sigspec is reset to
            the value it had when the shell was started.  If action is the null
            string the signal specified by each sigspec is ignored by the shell
            and by the commands it invokes.

            If  no arguments are supplied, trap displays the actions associated
            with each trapped signal as a set of  trap  commands  that  can  be
            reused  as  shell input to restore the current signal dispositions.
            If -p is given, and action is not present, then trap  displays  the
            actions  associated with each sigspec or, if none are supplied, for
            all trapped signals, as a set of trap commands that can  be  reused
            as  shell input to restore the current signal dispositions.  The -P
            option behaves similarly, but displays only the actions  associated
            with each sigspec argument.  -P requires at least one sigspec argu-
            ment.   The  -P or -p options may be used in a subshell environment
            (e.g., command substitution) and, as long as they are  used  before
            trap  is used to change a signal's handling, will display the state
            of its parent's traps.

            The -l option prints a list of signal names and their corresponding
            numbers.  Each sigspec is either a signal  name  defined  in  <sig-
            nal.h>,  or a signal number.  Signal names are case insensitive and
            the SIG prefix is optional.  If -l is supplied with no sigspec  ar-
            guments, it prints a list of valid signal names.

            If  a  sigspec  is  EXIT  (0),  action is executed on exit from the
            shell.  If a sigspec is DEBUG, action is executed before every sim-
            ple command, for command, case command, select command,  ((  arith-
            metic  command, [[ conditional command, arithmetic for command, and
            before the first command executes in a shell  function  (see  SHELL
            GRAMMAR above).  Refer to the description of the extdebug shell op-
            tion (see shopt above) for details of its effect on the DEBUG trap.
            If  a sigspec is RETURN, action is executed each time a shell func-
            tion or a script executed with the . or  source  builtins  finishes
            executing.

            If  a sigspec is ERR, action is executed whenever a pipeline (which
            may consist of a single simple command), a list, or a compound com-
            mand returns a non-zero exit status, subject to the following  con-
            ditions.   The  ERR  trap  is not executed if the failed command is
            part of the command list immediately following a while or until re-
            served word, part of the test in an if statement, part of a command
            executed in a && or || list except the command following the  final
            &&  or  ||,  any command in a pipeline but the last (subject to the
            state of the pipefail shell option), or  if  the  command's  return
            value  is  being  inverted  using !.  These are the same conditions
            obeyed by the errexit (-e) option.

            When the shell is not interactive, signals ignored  upon  entry  to
            the  shell  cannot  be trapped or reset.  Interactive shells permit
            trapping signals ignored on entry.  Trapped signals  that  are  not
            being  ignored  are reset to their original values in a subshell or
            subshell environment when one is created.   The  return  status  is
            false if any sigspec is invalid; otherwise trap returns true.

     true   Does nothing, returns a 0 status.

     type [-aftpP] name [name ...]
            Indicate  how  each  name would be interpreted if used as a command
            name.

            If the -t option is used, type prints a  string  which  is  one  of
            alias,  keyword,  function,  builtin,  or file if name is an alias,
            shell reserved word, function, builtin, or executable file, respec-
            tively.  If the name is not found, type prints nothing and  returns
            a non-zero exit status.

            If  the  -p option is used, type either returns the pathname of the
            executable file that would be found by searching $PATH for name  or
            nothing  if  "type  -t  name" would not return file.  The -P option
            forces a PATH search for each name, even if "type  -t  name"  would
            not  return  file.   If name is present in the table of hashed com-
            mands, -p and -P print the hashed value, which is  not  necessarily
            the file that appears first in PATH.

            If  the  -a option is used, type prints all of the places that con-
            tain a command named name.  This includes aliases, reserved  words,
            functions,  and  builtins,  but the path search options (-p and -P)
            can be supplied to restrict the output to executable  files.   type
            does  not  consult  the table of hashed commands when using -a with
            -p, and only performs a PATH search for name.

            The -f option suppresses shell function lookup, as with the command
            builtin.  type returns true if all  of  the  arguments  are  found,
            false if any are not found.

     ulimit [-HS] -a
     ulimit [-HS] [-bcdefiklmnpqrstuvxPRT [limit]]
            Provides  control  over the resources available to the shell and to
            processes it starts, on systems that allow such control.

            The -H and -S options specify whether the hard or soft limit is set
            for the given resource.  A hard limit cannot be increased by a non-
            root user once it is set; a soft limit may be increased up  to  the
            value of the hard limit.  If neither -H nor -S is specified, ulimit
            sets both the soft and hard limits.

            The  value  of  limit can be a number in the unit specified for the
            resource or one of the special values  hard,  soft,  or  unlimited,
            which stand for the current hard limit, the current soft limit, and
            no  limit,  respectively.   If  limit is omitted, ulimit prints the
            current value of the soft limit of the resource, unless the -H  op-
            tion is given.  When more than one resource is specified, the limit
            name and unit, if appropriate, are printed before the value.  Other
            options are interpreted as follows:
            -a     Report all current limits; no limits are set.
            -b     The maximum socket buffer size.
            -c     The maximum size of core files created.
            -d     The maximum size of a process's data segment.
            -e     The maximum scheduling priority ("nice").
            -f     The maximum size of files written by the shell and its chil-
                   dren.
            -i     The maximum number of pending signals.
            -k     The maximum number of kqueues that may be allocated.
            -l     The maximum size that may be locked into memory.
            -m     The  maximum  resident  set  size (many systems do not honor
                   this limit).
            -n     The maximum number of open file descriptors (most systems do
                   not allow this value to be set).
            -p     The pipe size in 512-byte blocks (this may not be set).
            -q     The maximum number of bytes in POSIX message queues.
            -r     The maximum real-time scheduling priority.
            -s     The maximum stack size.
            -t     The maximum amount of cpu time in seconds.
            -u     The maximum number of processes available to a single user.
            -v     The maximum amount of virtual memory available to the  shell
                   and, on some systems, to its children.
            -x     The maximum number of file locks.
            -P     The maximum number of pseudoterminals.
            -R     The  maximum  time a real-time process can run before block-
                   ing, in microseconds.
            -T     The maximum number of threads.

            If limit is supplied, and the -a option is not used, limit  is  the
            new  value  of  the  specified resource.  If no option is supplied,
            then -f is assumed.

            Values are in 1024-byte increments, except for -t, which is in sec-
            onds; -R, which is in  microseconds;  -p,  which  is  in  units  of
            512-byte  blocks;  -P,  -T,  -b, -k, -n, and -u, which are unscaled
            values; and, when in posix mode, -c and -f, which are  in  512-byte
            increments.  The return status is 0 unless an invalid option or ar-
            gument is supplied, or an error occurs while setting a new limit.

     umask [-p] [-S] [mode]
            Set  the  user  file-creation  mask to mode.  If mode begins with a
            digit, it is interpreted as an octal number; otherwise it is inter-
            preted as  a  symbolic  mode  mask  similar  to  that  accepted  by
            chmod(1).   If  mode  is omitted, umask prints the current value of
            the mask.  The -S option without a mode argument prints the mask in
            a symbolic format; the default output is an octal number.   If  the
            -p option is supplied, and mode is omitted, the output is in a form
            that may be reused as input.  The return status is zero if the mode
            was  successfully  changed or if no mode argument was supplied, and
            non-zero otherwise.

     unalias [-a] [name ...]
            Remove each name from the list of defined aliases.  If -a  is  sup-
            plied,  remove all alias definitions.  The return value is true un-
            less a supplied name is not a defined alias.

     unset [-fv] [-n] [name ...]
            For each name, remove the corresponding variable or  function.   If
            the  -v  option is given, each name refers to a shell variable, and
            that variable is removed.  If -f is specified, each name refers  to
            a  shell  function, and the function definition is removed.  If the
            -n option is supplied, and name is a variable with the nameref  at-
            tribute, name will be unset rather than the variable it references.
            -n has no effect if the -f option is supplied.  Read-only variables
            and  functions  may  not be unset.  When variables or functions are
            removed, they are also removed from the environment passed to  sub-
            sequent  commands.  If no options are supplied, each name refers to
            a variable; if there is no variable by that name, a  function  with
            that  name,  if any, is unset.  Some shell variables may not be un-
            set.  If any of BASH_ALIASES, BASH_ARGV0, BASH_CMDS,  BASH_COMMAND,
            BASH_SUBSHELL,  BASHPID,  COMP_WORDBREAKS, DIRSTACK, EPOCHREALTIME,
            EPOCHSECONDS, FUNCNAME, GROUPS, HISTCMD, LINENO,  RANDOM,  SECONDS,
            or  SRANDOM  are unset, they lose their special properties, even if
            they are subsequently reset.  The exit status is true unless a name
            is readonly or may not be unset.

     wait [-fn] [-p varname] [id ...]
            Wait for each specified child process id and return the termination
            status of the last id.  Each id may be a process ID pid  or  a  job
            specification jobspec; if a jobspec is supplied, wait waits for all
            processes in the job.

            If no options or ids are supplied, wait waits for all running back-
            ground  jobs  and  the  last-executed  process substitution, if its
            process id is the same as $!, and the return status is zero.

            If the -n option is supplied, wait waits for any one of  the  given
            ids or, if no ids are supplied, any job or process substitution, to
            complete  and returns its exit status.  If none of the supplied ids
            is a child of the shell, or if no ids are supplied  and  the  shell
            has no unwaited-for children, the exit status is 127.

            If the -p option is supplied, wait assigns the process or job iden-
            tifier  of  the  job  for  which the exit status is returned to the
            variable varname named by the option argument.  The variable, which
            cannot be readonly, will be unset initially, before any assignment.
            This is useful only when used with the -n option.

            Supplying the -f option, when job control is enabled,  forces  wait
            to  wait  for each id to terminate before returning its status, in-
            stead of returning when it changes status.

            If none of  the  ids  specify  one  of  the  shell's  active  child
            processes,  the  return status is 127.  If wait is interrupted by a
            signal, any varname will remain unset, and the return  status  will
            be  greater than 128, as described under SIGNALS above.  Otherwise,
            the return status is the exit status of the last id.

SHELL COMPATIBILITY MODE
     Bash-4.0 introduced the concept of a shell compatibility level,  specified
     as  a  set  of options to the shopt builtin (compat31, compat32, compat40,
     compat41, and so on).  There is only one current  compatibility  level  --
     each option is mutually exclusive.  The compatibility level is intended to
     allow users to select behavior from previous versions that is incompatible
     with newer versions while they migrate scripts to use current features and
     behavior.  It's intended to be a temporary solution.

     This  section  does not mention behavior that is standard for a particular
     version (e.g., setting compat32 means that quoting the right hand side  of
     the regexp matching operator quotes special regexp characters in the word,
     which is default behavior in bash-3.2 and subsequent versions).

     If a user enables, say, compat32, it may affect the behavior of other com-
     patibility  levels  up  to  and including the current compatibility level.
     The idea is that each compatibility level controls behavior  that  changed
     in  that  version of bash, but that behavior may have been present in ear-
     lier versions.  For instance, the change to use  locale-based  comparisons
     with  the  [[  command  came in bash-4.1, and earlier versions used ASCII-
     based comparisons, so enabling compat32 will  enable  ASCII-based  compar-
     isons  as  well.  That granularity may not be sufficient for all uses, and
     as a result users should employ compatibility levels carefully.  Read  the
     documentation for a particular feature to find out the current behavior.

     Bash-4.3 introduced a new shell variable: BASH_COMPAT.  The value assigned
     to  this variable (a decimal version number like 4.2, or an integer corre-
     sponding to the compatNN option, like  42)  determines  the  compatibility
     level.

     Starting with bash-4.4, bash began deprecating older compatibility levels.
     Eventually, the options will be removed in favor of BASH_COMPAT.

     Bash-5.0 was the final version for which there was an individual shopt op-
     tion  for the previous version.  BASH_COMPAT is the only mechanism to con-
     trol the compatibility level in versions newer than bash-5.0.

     The following table describes the behavior changes controlled by each com-
     patibility level setting.  The compatNN tag is used as shorthand for  set-
     ting  the compatibility level to NN using one of the following mechanisms.
     For versions prior to bash-5.0, the compatibility level may be  set  using
     the corresponding compatNN shopt option.  For bash-4.3 and later versions,
     the BASH_COMPAT variable is preferred, and it is required for bash-5.1 and
     later versions.

     compat31
            *      Quoting the rhs of the [[ command's regexp matching operator
                   (=~) has no special effect.

     compat32
            *      The  < and > operators to the [[ command do not consider the
                   current locale when comparing strings; they use ASCII order-
                   ing.

     compat40
            *      The < and > operators to the [[ command do not consider  the
                   current locale when comparing strings; they use ASCII order-
                   ing.   Bash  versions  prior to bash-4.1 use ASCII collation
                   and strcmp(3); bash-4.1 and later use the  current  locale's
                   collation sequence and strcoll(3).

     compat41
            *      In  posix mode, time may be followed by options and still be
                   recognized as a reserved word (this is POSIX  interpretation
                   267).
            *      In  posix  mode,  the parser requires that an even number of
                   single quotes occur in the word portion of  a  double-quoted
                   parameter expansion and treats them specially, so that char-
                   acters  within the single quotes are considered quoted (this
                   is POSIX interpretation 221).

     compat42
            *      The replacement string in double-quoted pattern substitution
                   does not undergo quote removal, as it does in versions after
                   bash-4.2.
            *      In posix mode, single quotes are considered special when ex-
                   panding the word portion of a double-quoted parameter expan-
                   sion and can be used to quote a closing brace or other  spe-
                   cial  character  (this is part of POSIX interpretation 221);
                   in later versions, single quotes are not special within dou-
                   ble-quoted word expansions.

     compat43
            *      Word expansion errors are considered non-fatal  errors  that
                   cause  the  current command to fail, even in posix mode (the
                   default behavior is to make them fatal errors that cause the
                   shell to exit).
            *      When executing a shell function, the loop  state  (while/un-
                   til/etc.)   is not reset, so break or continue in that func-
                   tion will break or continue loops in  the  calling  context.
                   Bash-4.4 and later reset the loop state to prevent this.

     compat44
            *      The shell sets up the values used by BASH_ARGV and BASH_ARGC
                   so they can expand to the shell's positional parameters even
                   if extended debugging mode is not enabled.
            *      A  subshell inherits loops from its parent context, so break
                   or continue will cause the subshell to exit.   Bash-5.0  and
                   later reset the loop state to prevent the exit
            *      Variable  assignments  preceding  builtins  like  export and
                   readonly that set attributes continue  to  affect  variables
                   with  the  same  name in the calling environment even if the
                   shell is not in posix mode.

     compat50
            *      Bash-5.1 changed the way $RANDOM is generated  to  introduce
                   slightly  more randomness.  If the shell compatibility level
                   is set to 50  or  lower,  it  reverts  to  the  method  from
                   bash-5.0 and previous versions, so seeding the random number
                   generator  by  assigning  a value to RANDOM will produce the
                   same sequence as in bash-5.0.
            *      If the command hash table is empty, bash versions  prior  to
                   bash-5.1  printed  an  informational message to that effect,
                   even when producing output that  can  be  reused  as  input.
                   Bash-5.1  suppresses that message when the -l option is sup-
                   plied.

     compat51
            *      The unset builtin treats attempts to unset array  subscripts
                   @  and  *  differently depending on whether the array is in-
                   dexed or associative, and differently than in previous  ver-
                   sions.
            *      Arithmetic  commands  (  ((...)) ) and the expressions in an
                   arithmetic for statement can be expanded more than once.
            *      Expressions used as arguments to arithmetic operators in the
                   [[ conditional command can be expanded more than once.
            *      The expressions in substring parameter brace  expansion  can
                   be expanded more than once.
            *      The  expressions  in  the $((...)) word expansion can be ex-
                   panded more than once.
            *      Arithmetic expressions used as indexed array subscripts  can
                   be expanded more than once.
            *      test  -v,  when given an argument of A[@], where A is an ex-
                   isting associative array, will return true if the array  has
                   any  set  elements.   Bash-5.2 will look for and report on a
                   key named @.
            *      The ${parameter[:]=value} word expansion will return  value,
                   before  any variable-specific transformations have been per-
                   formed (e.g., converting to lowercase).  Bash-5.2  will  re-
                   turn the final value assigned to the variable.
            *      Parsing  command  substitutions  will  behave as if extended
                   globbing (see the description of the shopt builtin above) is
                   enabled, so that parsing a command  substitution  containing
                   an  extglob  pattern (say, as part of a shell function) will
                   not fail.  This assumes the intent is to enable extglob  be-
                   fore  the  command  is executed and word expansions are per-
                   formed.  It will fail at  word  expansion  time  if  extglob
                   hasn't been enabled by the time the command is executed.

     compat52
            *      The  test  builtin  uses  its  historical algorithm to parse
                   parenthesized subexpressions when given five or  more  argu-
                   ments.
            *      If the -p or -P option is supplied to the bind builtin, bind
                   treats  any  arguments  remaining after option processing as
                   bindable command names, and displays any key sequences bound
                   to those commands, instead of treating the arguments as  key
                   sequences to bind.

RESTRICTED SHELL
     If  bash  is  started with the name rbash, or the -r option is supplied at
     invocation, the shell becomes restricted.  A restricted shell is  used  to
     set up an environment more controlled than the standard shell.  It behaves
     identically  to  bash with the exception that the following are disallowed
     or not performed:

     *      Changing directories with cd.

     *      Setting or unsetting the values of SHELL, PATH, HISTFILE,  ENV,  or
            BASH_ENV.

     *      Specifying command names containing /.

     *      Specifying  a  filename  containing  a  /  as  an argument to the .
            builtin command.

     *      Using the -p option to the .  builtin command to specify  a  search
            path.

     *      Specifying a filename containing a slash as an argument to the his-
            tory builtin command.

     *      Specifying  a  filename containing a slash as an argument to the -p
            option to the hash builtin command.

     *      Importing  function  definitions  from  the  shell  environment  at
            startup.

     *      Parsing  the  values of BASHOPTS and SHELLOPTS from the shell envi-
            ronment at startup.

     *      Redirecting output using the >, >|, <>, >&, &>, and >>  redirection
            operators.

     *      Using  the  exec  builtin command to replace the shell with another
            command.

     *      Adding or deleting builtin commands with the -f and -d  options  to
            the enable builtin command.

     *      Using the enable builtin command to enable disabled shell builtins.

     *      Specifying the -p option to the command builtin command.

     *      Turning   off   restricted  mode  with  set  +r  or  shopt  -u  re-
            stricted_shell.

     These restrictions are enforced after any startup files are read.

     When a command that is found to be a shell script is executed (see COMMAND
     EXECUTION above), rbash turns off any restrictions in the shell spawned to
     execute the script.

BUG REPORTS
     If you find a bug in bash, you should report it.  But  first,  you  should
     make  sure that it really is a bug, and that it appears in the latest ver-
     sion  of  bash.    The   latest   version   is   always   available   from
     ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/bash/            and           http://git.savan-
     nah.gnu.org/cgit/bash.git/snapshot/bash-master.tar.gz.

     Once you have determined that a bug actually exists, use the bashbug  com-
     mand  to  submit  a  bug report.  If you have a fix, you are encouraged to
     mail that as well!  You may send suggestions and "philosophical"  bug  re-
     ports   to   bug-bash@gnu.org   or  post  them  to  the  Usenet  newsgroup
     gnu.bash.bug.

     ALL bug reports should include:

     The version number of bash
     The hardware and operating system
     The compiler used to compile
     A description of the bug behavior
     A short script or "recipe" which exercises the bug

     bashbug inserts the first three items automatically into the  template  it
     provides for filing a bug report.

     Comments and bug reports concerning this manual page should be directed to
     chet.ramey@case.edu.

BUGS
     It's too big and too slow.

     There are some subtle differences between bash and traditional versions of
     sh, mostly because of the POSIX specification.

     Aliases are confusing in some uses.

     Shell builtin commands and functions are not stoppable/restartable.

     Compound  commands  and command lists of the form "a ; b ; c" are not han-
     dled gracefully when combined with process suspension.  When a process  is
     stopped,  the  shell  immediately executes the next command in the list or
     breaks out of any existing loops.  It suffices to enclose the  command  in
     parentheses  to  force it into a subshell, which may be stopped as a unit,
     or to start the command in the background and immediately  bring  it  into
     the foreground.

     Array variables may not (yet) be exported.
